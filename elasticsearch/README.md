##Todo

* English: "1 Results"
* Why does it say 1 result when we have a listing of 10? It seems to always return 10. Shall I just trim them to the n number?
* Show the score next to the matches
* Show example syntax
* Show similar matches to the one we are clicking on
* Split into separate files
* Add documentation; in fact write the files in literate coffeescript.
* Have a button that shows a detail that shows us the whole document.
* Breadcrumbs showing past few queries or show them in a sidebar if too wide.
* Do not yellow-highlight the `<thead/>`
* Is there a smoother way to transition between notifications?
* Load in example publications showing little documents as previews showing detail when clicking on them.
* D3 color scales for scores
* Why are scores not sorted?
* If many names, skip the middle people (like in Micklem Site)
* Highlight the matching keywords
* Show spyglass (webfont) onhover page preview
* Have a minified build
* Change the notification to be shown as a text in a title, e.g.: Top results out of 27 etc.
