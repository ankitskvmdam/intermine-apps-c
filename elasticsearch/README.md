##Todo

[x] Do not re-render the input field if I am typing in at that very moment; prevents me from typing something in the middle of a query.
[ ] English: "1 Results"
[ ] Why does it say 1 result when we have a listing of 10?
[ ] Show the score next to the matches
[ ] Show example syntax
[ ] Show similar matches to the one we are clicking on
[ ] Split into separate files
[ ] Add documentation; in fact write the files in literate coffeescript.
[ ] Have a button that shows a detail that shows us the whole document.
[ ] Breadcrumbs showing past few queries or show them in a sidebar if too wide.
[ ] Do not yellow-highlight the `<thead/>`
[ ] Have a link to load example documents in instead of doing it every time
[ ] Is there a smoother way to transition between notifications?
[ ] Load in example publications showing little documents as previews showing detail when clicking on them.
