##Todo

* English: "1 Results"
* Show example syntax
* Show similar matches to the one we are clicking on
* Split into separate files
* Add documentation; in fact write the files in literate coffeescript.
* Have a button that shows a detail that shows us the whole document.
* Breadcrumbs showing past few queries or show them in a sidebar if too wide.
* Is there a smoother way to transition between notifications?
* Load in example publications showing little documents as previews showing detail when clicking on them.
* If many names, skip the middle people (like in Micklem Site)
* Show spyglass (webfont) onhover page preview
* Have a minified build
* Change the notification to be shown as a text in a title, e.g.: Top results out of 27 etc.
