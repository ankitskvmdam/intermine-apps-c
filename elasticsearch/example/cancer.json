        "abstract": "Several lines of investigation have revealed the apparent interplay between the immune system of the host and many conventional, \"standard-of-care\" anticancer therapies, including chemotherapy and small molecule targeted therapeutics. In particular, preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the important role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in inhibiting immune responses elicited by immunotherapeutic regimens such as those based on anticancer vaccines or checkpoint inhibitors. However, how the number and immunosuppressive function of Tregs change in cancer patients undergoing treatment with non-immune anticancer therapies remains to be precisely elucidated. To determine whether immunostimulatory therapies can be employed successfully in combination with conventional anticancer regimens, we have investigated both the number and function of Tregs obtained from the peripheral blood of carcinoma patients before the initiation and during the course of chemotherapeutic and targeted agent regimens. Our studies show that the treatment of breast cancer patients with tamoxifen plus leuprolide, a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist, has minimal effects on Tregs, while sunitinib appears to exert differential effects on Tregs among patients with metastatic renal carcinoma. However, the administration of docetaxel to patients with metastatic prostate or breast cancer, as well as that of cisplatin plus vinorelbine to non-small cell lung cancer patients, appears to significantly increase the ratio between effector T cells and Tregs and to reduce the immunosuppressive activity of the latter in the majority of patients. These studies provide the rationale for the selective use of active immunotherapy regimens in combination with specific standard-of-care therapies to achieve the most beneficial clinical outcome among carcinoma patients.",

        "abstract": "Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) is a pediatric cancer that is conventionally treated by surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Innovative immunotherapies to treat EWS are currently under development. Unfortunately for EWS patients, when the disease is found to be resistant to current therapeutic approaches, the prognosis is predictably grim. Radiation therapy and immunotherapy could potentially synergize in the eradication of EWS, as some studies have previously shown that irradiation increases the presence of immune receptors, including MHC class I molecules, on the surface of tumor cells. However, EWS cells have been reported to express low levels of MHC class I molecules, a phenotype that would inhibit T-cell mediated lysis. We have previously demonstrated that the transgene-driven overexpression of amyloid β (A4) precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) reduces the expression of MHC class I molecules on the surface of human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. We thus examined whether endogenously expressed APLP2 downregulates MHC class I expression on EWS cells, particularly upon irradiation. We found that irradiation induces the relocalization of APLP2 and MHC class I molecules on the surface of EWS cells, redistributing cells from subpopulations with relatively low APLP2 and high MHC class I into subpopulations with relatively high APLP2 and low MHC class I surface expression. Consistent with these findings, the transfection of an APLP2-targeting siRNA into EWS cells increased MHC class I expression on the cell surface. Furthermore, APLP2 was found by co-immunoprecipitation to bind to MHC class I molecules. Taken together, these findings suggest that APLP2 inhibits MHC class I expression on the surface of irradiated EWS cells by a mechanism that involves APLP2/MHC class I interactions. Thus, therapeutic strategies that limit APLP2 expression may boost the ability of T cells to recognize and eradicate EWS in patients.",

Our 36-year old proband presented with incidentally detected thrombocytopenia and a family history suggestive of FPDMM. Contrary to previously described families, affected members of our kindred express an eczematous phenotype, reportedly most severe in members who develop leukemia. Pedigree analysis shows that the L472X mutation tracks with thrombocytopenia, acute leukemia, and eczema. The L472X mutation produces a stably expressed RUNX1 protein product with a corresponding decrease in wild type RUNX1 expression. Our data supports the inclusion of eczema in the FPDMM phenotype and suggests the possibility that the RUNX1 L472X mutant causes the type of dominant negative affect that is associated with an elevated risk of leukemia in FPDMM families.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths of women in the United States. Fortunately, the mortality rate from breast cancer has decreased in recent years due to an increased emphasis on early detection and more effective treatments. Although great advancements have been made in the treatment and control of cancer progression, significant deficiencies and room for improvement remain. The central objective of this research was to further determine the in vitro mechanisms of Vernonia amygdalina (VA) leaf extracts as an anticancer candidate for the treatment of breast cancer. To achieve our objective, MCF-7 cells were treated with different concentrations of VA for 24 hand 48 h. Cell viability, live and dead cells were determined by the means of trypan blue exclusion test. Live and dead cells were further evaluated by propidium iodine (PI) assay using the Cellometer Vision. Cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry assessment using annexin V/PI kit. Data obtained from the trypan blue test demonstrated that VA treatment reduces cell viability in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Result of the PI assay showed a gradual increase in the population of necrotic cells (fluorescence positive cells) in VA-treated cells compared to the control cells (fluorescence negative cells). Treatment of these cancer cells (MCF-7) for 48 h at concentrations ranging from 250 μg/mL to 1000 μg/mL caused early signs of apoptosis resulting from phosphatidylserine externalization as judged by annexin V assay. We observed a strong concentration-response relationship with regard to VA exposure and annexin V/PI positive cells. In summary, our finding demonstrates that VA-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in MCF-7 cells involve phosphatidylserine externalization accompanied by secondary necrotic cell death. With previous findings in our laboratory, the data generated in the present study confirms that VA is a valuable botanical therapeutic agent for the treatment of breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Immune responses generated against malignant cells have the potential to inhibit tumor growth, or even eliminate transformed cells before a tumor forms. However, immune tolerance mechanisms that normally protect healthy tissues from autoimmune damage pose a formidable barrier to the development of effective anti-tumor immunity. Because malignant cells are derived from self-tissues, the majority of defined tumor antigens are either shared or aberrantly expressed self-proteins. Eliciting productive T cell responses against such proteins is challenging, as most high-affinity, self-reactive T cells are purged during thymic selection. Some T cells capable of tumor antigen recognition escape thymic deletion, but are functionally inhibited by peripheral tolerance mechanisms which limit their ability to attack a developing malignancy. Alternatively, some tumors express antigens derived from mutated self-proteins, viral proteins or self proteins expressed only during embryonic development. These antigens are recognized by the immune system as foreign and could be recognized by a relatively large number of peripheral T cells. Even in this scenario, tumors evade otherwise effective T cell responses by employing potent immunosuppressive mechanisms within their local environment. In the setting for solid malignancies, such as melanoma, a growing number of putative immune evasion mechanisms have been characterized. However, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a systemic disease, and the pathways it exploits to subvert the host immune response may be quite different than those of a solid tumor. Much remains unknown regarding the immune escape mechanisms promoted by AML, and whether efforts to thwart tolerance may influence the progression of this disease. Here, we review current concepts of immune evasion in AML, and speculate how potentially effective immunotherapeutic strategies might be developed to reverse immune tolerance in leukemia patients in the future.",

Engaging the community in research is important in the development, dissemination, and evaluation of new interventions, technologies, and other medical advancements to improve population health globally. A review of published community-engaged research studies conducted in India was performed. Fifteen published studies were identified and reviewed to evaluate the state of community-engaged research in India. The review indicated that community-engaged research in India is limited. Most published community-engaged research focused on health promotion, especially in the prevention or management of HIV/AIDS and other STIs. Community members were involved in a variety of aspects of the research, but there was not one published article indicating that community members had defined the disease of focus. Community-engaged research often led to valuable insights into the views, experiences, and behaviors of community members and also led to increased community participation in health initiatives. It is anticipated that future community-engaged research will lead to improvements in global health through increased empowerment of communities and a better ability to implement new and innovative medical advances, technologies, and interventions.",

The coupling of multiphoton fluorescence, second harmonic generation, and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) has allowed investigation of a broad range of biological questions concerning lipid metabolism, cancer development, cardiovascular disease, and skin biology. Moreover, recent research shows the great potential of using CARS microscope as a platform to develop more advanced NLO modalities such as electronic-resonance-enhanced four-wave mixing, stimulated Raman scattering, and pump-probe microscopy. This article reviews the various approaches developed for realization of multimodal NLO imaging as well as developments of new NLO modalities on a CARS microscope. Applications to various aspects of biological and biomedical research are discussed.",

Ophthalmic and ocular adnexal NHL have unique incidence patterns, including equal rates among both genders, predominance among Asians/Pacific Islanders, and steady and rapid increases in the past few decades. Studies of international variations in the incidence of ocular adnexal NHL may provide clues as to the underlying mechanisms influencing its unique epidemiology.",

The aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the precise association between this polymorphism and CRC risk. Methods: We formally reviewed the literature at Pubmed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library with the key words as follows: ABCB1/MDR1/P-glycoprotein, polymorphism, colorectal and cancer/neoplasm/tumor. This meta-analysis was assessed by Review manager 5.0. The fixed-effects model was used to pool the odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for CRC risk. Results: There were 8 studies identified. The pooled OR with 95% CI of CC+CT versus TT genotype of the ABCB1 3435C>T polymorphism for CRC risk was 1.01 [0.90-1.13]. The sensitivity analysis further confirmed the result. Heterogeneity and publication bias were not observed in this meta-analysis. Conclusions: In summary, there was no significant association between the ABCB1 3435C>T polymorphism and CRC risk. Abbreviations used: the ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B, member 1 (ABCB1); multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1); P-glycoprotein (P-gp); colorectal cancer (CRC); single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); odds ratio (OR); confidence interval (CI); Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE).",

Previous studies regarding the association of folate intake and Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T polymorphism with ESCC was conflicting. We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association of MTHFR C677T and folate intake with esophageal cancer risk. Methodology: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Chinese Biomedical Database were searched in our study. The quality of studies were evaluated by predefined scale, and The association of polymorphisms of MTHFR C677T and folate intake and ESCC risk was estimated by Odds ratio (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Nineteen studies (4239 cases and 5575 controls) were included for meta-analysis. A significant association was seen between individuals with MTHFR 677 CT [OR(95%)=1.47(1.32-1.63)] and TT [OR(95%)=1.69(1.49-1.91)] genotypes and ESCC risk (p<0.05). Low intake of folate had significantly higher risk of esophageal cancer among individuals with CT/TT genotype [OR(95%)=1.65(1.1-2.49)], while high intake of folate did not find significant high risk of esophageal cancer among individuals with CT/TT genotype [OR(95%)=1.64 (0.82-3.26)]. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis indicated the folate intake and MTHFR 677CT/TT are associated with the risk of ESCC, and folate showed a significant interaction with polymorphism of MTHFR C677T.",

As the population ages in Western countries, the number of people being diagnosed with glioblastoma is expected to increase. Clinical management of elderly patients with primary brain tumors is difficult, owing to multiple comorbidities, polypharmacy, decreased tolerance to chemotherapy, and an increased risk of radiation-induced neurotoxicity. A few specific randomized studies have shown a benefit for radiotherapy in elderly patients with good performance status. For patients with poor performance status, chemotherapy (temozolomide) has been shown to be associated with prolonged duration of response. Patients with methylated O (6)-alkylguanine deoxyribonucleic acid alkyltransferase promoter seem to have better outcomes. Oncogeriatrics proposes the geriatric evaluation of elderly patients to improve therapeutic choices and optimize the management of treatment toxicities and comorbidities.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we present a novel, automated, registration method to fuse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images of the prostate. Our methodology consists of: (1) delineating the prostate on MRI, (2) building a probabilistic model of prostate location on TRUS, and (3) aligning the MRI prostate segmentation to the TRUS probabilistic model. TRUS-guided needle biopsy is the current gold standard for prostate cancer (CaP) diagnosis. Up to 40% of CaP lesions appear isoechoic on TRUS, hence TRUS-guided biopsy cannot reliably target CaP lesions and is associated with a high false negative rate. MRI is better able to distinguish CaP from benign prostatic tissue, but requires special equipment and training. MRI-TRUS fusion, whereby MRI is acquired pre-operatively and aligned to TRUS during the biopsy procedure, allows for information from both modalities to be used to help guide the biopsy. The use of MRI and TRUS in combination to guide biopsy at least doubles the yield of positive biopsies. Previous work on MRI-TRUS fusion has involved aligning manually determined fiducials or prostate surfaces to achieve image registration. The accuracy of these methods is dependent on the reader's ability to determine fiducials or prostate surfaces with minimal error, which is a difficult and time-consuming task. Our novel, fully automated MRI-TRUS fusion method represents a significant advance over the current state-of-the-art because it does not require manual intervention after TRUS acquisition. All necessary preprocessing steps (i.e. delineation of the prostate on MRI) can be performed offline prior to the biopsy procedure. We evaluated our method on seven patient studies, with B-mode TRUS and a 1.5 T surface coil MRI. Our method has a root mean square error (RMSE) for expertly selected fiducials (consisting of the urethra, calcifications, and the centroids of CaP nodules) of 3.39 ± 0.85 mm.",

We demonstrate herein the use of Richardson-Lucy deconvolution to deblur luminescence images obtained via multiphoton scanning microscopy. Images were taken of three dimensional models of colon and ovarian cancer following incubation with NaYF4:Yb,Er nanoparticles functionalized with an antibody for EGFR and folic acid respectively. Following deconvolution, images had a lateral resolution on par with the optimal performance of the imaging system used, ~1.2 μm, and an axial resolution of ~5 μm. Due to the relatively high multiphoton excitation efficiency of these nanoparticles, it is possible to follow binding of individual particles in tissue. In addition, their extreme photostability allows for prolonged imaging without significant loss in luminescence signal. With these advantageous properties in mind, we also discuss the potential application of upconverting lanthanide nanoparticles for tracking of specific, cancer relevant receptors in tissue.",

        "abstract": "In breast conservation surgery, surgeons attempt to remove malignant tissue along with a surrounding margin of healthy tissue. Subsequent pathological analysis determines if those margins are clear of malignant tissue, a process that typically requires at least one day. Only then can it be determined whether a follow-up surgery is necessary. This possibility of re-excision is undesirable in terms of reducing patient morbidity, emotional stress and healthcare. It has been shown that terahertz (THz) images of breast specimens can accurately differentiate between breast carcinoma, normal fibroglandular tissue, and adipose tissue. That study employed the Time-Domain Spectroscopy (TDS) technique. We are instead developing a new technique, Frequency-Domain Terahertz Imaging (FDTI). In this joint project between UMass/Amherst and UMass Medical School/Worcester (UMMS), we are investigating the feasibility of the FDTI technique for THz reflection imaging of breast cancer margins. Our system, which produces mechanically scanned images of size 2cm × 2cm, uses a THz gas laser. The system is calibrated with mixtures of water and ethanol and reflection coefficients as low as 1% have been measured. Images from phantoms and specimens cut from breast cancer lumpectomies at UMMS will be presented. Finally, there will be a discussion of a possible transition of this FDTI setup to a compact and inexpensive CMOS THz camera for use in the operating room.",

        "abstract": "De Ritis described the ratio between the serum levels of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) almost 50 years ago. While initially described as a characteristic of acute viral hepatitis where ALT was usually higher than AST, other authors have subsequently found it useful in alcoholic hepatitis, where AST is usually higher than ALT. These interpretations are far too simplistic however as acute viral hepatitis can have AST greater than ALT, and this can be a sign of fulminant disease, while alcoholic hepatitis can have ALT greater than AST when several days have elapsed since alcohol exposure. The ratio therefore represents the time course and aggressiveness of disease that would be predicted from the relatively short half-life of AST (18 h) compared to ALT (36 h). In chronic viral illnesses such as chronic viral hepatitis and chronic alcoholism as well as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, an elevated AST/ALT ratio is predictive of long terms complications including fibrosis and cirrhosis. There are methodological issues, particularly whether or not pyridoxal phosphate is used in the transaminase assays, and although this can have specific effects when patient samples are deficient in this vitamin, these method differences generally have mild effects on the usefulness of the assays or the ratio. Ideally laboratories should be using pyridoxal phosphate supplemented assays in alcoholic, elderly and cancer patients who may be pyridoxine deplete. Ideally all laboratories reporting abnormal ALT should also report AST and calculate the De Ritis ratio because it provides useful diagnostic and prognostic information.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundThe aim of this study was to correlate MRI features and molecular characteristics in anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (AOs).MethodsThe MRI characteristics of 50 AO patients enrolled in the French national network for high-grade oligodendroglial tumors were analyzed. The genomic profiles and IDH mutational statuses were assessed using high-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays and direct sequencing, respectively. The gene expression profiles of 25 1p/19q-codeleted AOs were studied on Affymetrix expression arrays.ResultsMost of the cases were frontal lobe contrast-enhanced tumors (52%), but the radiological presentations of these cases were heterogeneous, ranging from low-grade glioma-like aspects (26%) to glioblastoma-like aspects (22%). The 1p/19q codeletion (n = 39) was associated with locations in the frontal lobe (P = .001), with heterogeneous intratumoral signal intensities (P = .003) and with no or nonmeasurable contrast enhancements (P = .01). The IDH wild-type AOs (n = 7) more frequently displayed ringlike contrast enhancements (P = .03) and were more frequently located outside of the frontal lobe (P = .01). However, no specific imaging pattern could be identified for the 1p/19q-codeleted AO or the IDH-mutated AO. Within the 1p/19q-codeleted AO, the contrast enhancement was associated with larger tumor volumes (P = .001), chromosome 9p loss and CDKN2A loss (P = .006), genomic instability (P = .03), and angiogenesis-related gene expression (P < .001), particularly for vascular endothelial growth factor A and angiopoietin 2.ConclusionIn AOs, the 1p/19q codeletion and the IDH mutation are associated with preferential (but not with specific) imaging characteristics. Within 1p/19q-codeleted AO, imaging heterogeneity is related to additional molecular alterations, especially chromosome 9p loss, which is associated with contrast enhancement and larger tumor volume.",

        "abstract": "The present studies determined whether clinically relevant phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors interacted with clinically relevant chemotherapies to kill gastrointestinal / genitourinary (GI/GU) cancer cells. In bladder cancer cells, regardless of H-RAS mutational status, at clinically achievable doses, PDE5 inhibitors interacted in a greater than additive fashion with doxorubicin / mitomycin C / gemcitabine / cisplatin / paclitaxel to cause cell death. In pancreatic tumor cells expressing mutant active K-RAS PDE5 inhibitors interacted in a greater than additive fashion with doxorubicin / gemcitabine / paclitaxel to cause cell death. The most potent PDE5 inhibitor was sildenafil. Knock down of PDE5 expression recapitulated the combination effects of PDE5 inhibitor drugs with chemotherapy drugs. Expression of c-FLIP-s did not significantly inhibit chemotherapy lethality but did significantly reduce enhanced killing in combination with sildenafil. Over-expression of BCL-XL suppressed individual and combination drug toxicities. Knock down of CD95 or FADD suppressed drug combination toxicity. Combination toxicity was also abolished by necrostatin or RIP1 knock down. Treatment with PDE5 inhibitors and chemotherapy drugs promoted autophagy which was maximal at ~24 h -post treatment, and 3-methyl adenine or knock down of Beclin1 suppressed drug combination lethality by ~50%. PDE5 inhibitors enhanced and prolonged the induction of DNA damage as judged by Comet assays and gamma H2AX and CHK2 phosphorylation. Knock down of ATM suppressed gamma H2AX and CHK2 phosphorylation and enhanced drug combination lethality. Collectively our data demonstrate that the combination of PDE5 inhibitors with standard of care chemotherapy agents for GI/GU cancers represents a novel modality.",

        "abstract": "The TSH receptor (TSHR) and sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) are key players in radioiodine-based treatment of differentiated thyroid cancers. While NIS expression is diminished/lost in most thyroid tumors, TSHR is usually preserved. To examine the mechanisms that regulate the expression of NIS and TSHR genes in thyroid tumor cells, we analyzed their expression after inhibition of ras-BRAF-MAPK and PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathways and the epigenetic control occurring at the gene promoter level in four human thyroid cancer cell lines. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure NIS and TSHR mRNA in thyroid cancer cell lines (TPC-1, BCPAP, WRO and FTC-133). Western blotting was used to assess levels of total and phosphorylated ERK and Akt. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed for investigating histone post-translational modifications of the TSHR and NIS genes. ERK and Akt inhibitors elicited different responses of the cells in terms of TSHR and NIS mRNA levels. Akt inhibition increased NIS transcript levels and reduced those of TSHR in FTC-133 cells but had no significant effects in BCPAP. ERK inhibition increased the expression of both genes in BCPAP cells but had no effects in FTC-133. Histone post-translational modifications observed in the basal state of the four cell lines as well as in BCPAP treated with ERK inhibitor and FTC-133 treated with Akt inhibitor show cell- and gene-specific differences. In conclusion, our data indicate that in thyroid cancer cells the expression of TSHR and NIS genes is differently controlled by multiple mechanisms, including epigenetic events elicited by major signaling pathways involved in thyroid tumorigenesis.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: Data from epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that dietary protein intake may play a role in inhibiting prostate and breast cancer by modulating the IGF/AKT/mTOR pathway. In this study we investigated the effects of diets with different protein content or quality on prostate and breast cancer. Experimental Design: To test our hypothesis we assessed the inhibitory effect of protein diet restriction on prostate and breast cancer growth, serum PSA and IGF-1 concentrations, mTOR activity and epigenetic markers, by using human xenograft cancer models. Results: Our results showed a 70% inhibition of tumor growth in the castrate-resistant LuCaP23.1 prostate cancer model and a 56% inhibition in the WHIM16 breast cancer model fed with a 7% protein diet when compared to an isocaloric 21% protein diet. Inhibition of tumor growth correlated, in the LuCaP23.1 model, with decreased serum PSA and IGF-1 levels, down-regulation of mTORC1 activity, decreased cell proliferation as indicated by Ki67 staining, and reduction in epigenetic markers of prostate cancer progression, including the histone methyltransferase EZH2 and the associated histone mark H3K27me3. In addition, we observed that modifications of dietary protein quality, independently of protein quantity, decreased tumor growth. A diet containing 20% plant protein inhibited tumor weight by 37% as compared to a 20% animal dairy protein diet. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a reduction in dietary protein intake is highly effective in inhibiting tumor growth in human xenograft prostate and breast cancer models, possibly through the inhibition of the IGF/AKT/mTOR pathway and epigenetic modifications.",

        "abstract": "Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), a vaccine against tuberculosis(TB), has been used and proven to be one of the most effective treatments for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (BCa). However, the mechanisms of BCG action have not been completely understood, thereby limiting the improvement of BCG therapy. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with a high risk of TB infection, and the beneficial effect of UV exposure in TB patients was proven to be mediated via activation of vitamin D signals of innate immune cells. Thus, vitamin D signals might be involved in mediating BCG immunotherapy. To test this hypothesis, we examined the impact of 1alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-VD) on BCG-induced response in BCa cells and macrophage cells. Our data revealed that 1,25-VD promotes BCG-induced interleukin 8 (IL-8) secretion by BCa cells, consequently inducing the migration of macrophage, THP-1. This THP-1 cell migration promoted by 1,25-VD can be blocked by IL-8 neutralized antibody. Furthermore, 1,25-VD increased BCG-induced expression of macrophage markers in THP-1 cell, and enhanced the BCG-induced THP-1 cytotoxicity against low-grade BCa cells. Importantly, a pre-clinical trial using the N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN)-induced BCa mouse model revealed that intravesical co-treatment of 1,25-VD with BCG can prolong mice survival. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism by which 1,25-VD promotes BCG-mediated anti-BCa pathways and provides a platform for improving BCG efficacy with combination of 1,25-VD.",

Subjects: A total of 108 patients, of whom 22 were children and adolescents and 86 were adults, and who were operated on for differentiated thyroid carcinoma during the period 2001-2009, were included in the study. Results: The rate of large thyroid, multinodular goiter, or tumor >1 cm was significantly higher in the adult group than in the pediatric group. Our analysis also revealed that that the frequency of lymph node metastasis was significantly higher in the pediatric group than in the adult group. Moreover, the frequencies of total lymph node and positive lymph node presentations were significantly higher in the pediatric group than in the adult group. Conclusion: Although thyroid carcinoma has a good prognosis in young patients, one must stress that late diagnosis and ineffective treatment are the main criteria for poor prognosis and, most important, that it is advisable to keep the management of thyroid carcinoma on a path that differs from the management of adult thyroid carcinomas, in nearly all aspects from presentation to treatment.",

        "abstract": "Anticancer agent-incorporating polymeric micelles accumulate effectively in tumors via the enhanced permeability and retention effect to exert potent antitumor effects. However, combined use of such micelles has not been elucidated. We compared the effect of combining the epirubicin-incorporating micelle NC-6300 and 1,2-diaminocyclohexane platinum (II) (oxaliplatin parent complex)-incorporating micelle NC-4016 (NCs) with that of epirubicin and oxaliplatin (E/O) in 44As3Luc cells using the combination index method. The in vivo antitumor activities of NCs and E/O were evaluated in mice bearing 44As3Luc xenografts. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Cardiotoxicity of NC-6300 and epirubicin was assessed by echocardiography. Neurotoxicity of NC-4016 and oxaliplatin was evaluated by examining the paw withdrawal response to noxious mechanical stimuli. NCs showed a highly synergistic activity equivalent to E/O. In vivo, NCs exhibited higher antitumor activity in the subcutaneous tumor model and longer overall survival in the orthotopic tumor model than E/O (p < 0.001, p = 0.015, respectively). The intratumor concentrations of epirubicin and platinum were significantly higher following NCs than following E/O administration. Moreover, the micelles showed lower cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity than the corresponding conventional drugs. The combined use of the micelles was associated with remarkable efficacy and favorable toxicities in the human gastric cancer model, and warrants the conduct of clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "Risk prediction models play an important role in prevention and treatment of several diseases. Models that are in clinical use are often refined and improved. In many instances, the most efficient way to improve a successful model is to identify subgroups for which there is a specific biological rationale for improvement and tailor the improved model to individuals in these subgroups, an approach especially in line with personalized medicine. At present, we lack statistical tools to evaluate improvements targeted to specific subgroups. Here, we propose simple tools to fill this gap. First, we extend a recently proposed measure, the Integrated Discrimination Improvement, using a linear model with covariates representing the subgroups. Next, we develop graphical and numerical tools that compare reclassification of two models, focusing only on those subjects for whom the two models reclassify differently. We apply these approaches to BRCAPRO, a genetic risk prediction model for breast and ovarian cancer, using data from MD Anderson Cancer Center. We also conduct a simulation study to investigate properties of the new reclassification measure and compare it with currently used measures. Our results show that the proposed tools can successfully uncover subgroup specific model improvements. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

However, factors such as unstable scope position, inappropriate location of the lesion, lesion mobility, and lesion characteristics may complicate the procedure. To overcome such difficulties, it is necessary to select the most suitable needle and consider several technical points according to each situation. We introduce our standard technique for EUS-FNA and provide several tips for ensuring a successful procedure.",

We performed an updated meta-analysis of 3,792 subjects (1,349 cancer cases and 2,443 controls) to summarize the data available for p53 codon 72 polymorphism and SCC risk. The association was estimated by odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). The meta-analysis showed no statistical significance for SCC risk associated with any of the genetic models of p53 codon 72 polymorphism. The analyses by ethnic subgroup also failed to produce significant associations. This study suggests that p53 codon 72 polymorphism does not appear to represent a significant susceptibility factor for SCC in Caucasians.",

        "abstract": "Ras-associated domain family 1A (RASSF1A) is a putative tumor suppressor gene located at 3p21.3, and the epigenetic inactivation of RASSF1A by hypermethylation of CpG islands within the promoter region has been observed in various cancer types, including prostate cancer (PCa). However, results from published studies on the association between RASSF1A promoter methylation and PCa risk are conflicting and inconclusive. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis of 19 eligible studies with odds ratio (OR) and its corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) in order to investigate the strength of relationship of RASSF1A promoter methylation with PCa risk and its clinicopathological variables. Overall, the RASSF1A promoter methylation was significantly associated with PCa risk (OR = 9.58, 95% CI 5.64-16.88, P heterogeneity <0.001) and Gleason score (GS) (OR = 2.58, 95% CI 1.64-4.04, P heterogeneity = 0.019). In addition, subgroup analysis by testing material demonstrated the significant association between RASSF1A methylation and GS (OR = 3.09, 95% CI 1.92-4.97, P heterogeneity =0.042), PSA level (OR = 2.75, 95% CI 1.67-4.52, P heterogeneity = 0.639), and tumor stage (OR = 1.74, 95% CI 1.05-2.87, P heterogeneity = 0.026) in tissue rather than urine samples. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggested that RASSF1A promoter methylation was significantly associated with an increased risk for PCa; furthermore, the RASSF1A methylation status in tissue rather than urine was positively correlated with GS, serum PSA level, and tumor stage, which can be utilized for the early detection and prognosis prediction of PCa.",

There were several case-controls studies published to assess the associations of VEGF polymorphisms with risk of prostate cancer, but the findings were inconsistent. We performed a meta-analysis to provide a comprehensive assessment of the associations of three VEGF polymorphisms with risk of prostate cancer. The pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) was calculated to assess the associations. Eleven individual case-control studies with a total of 5,209 cases of prostate cancer and 5,233 controls were finally included into our meta-analysis. Overall, VEGF rs833061 polymorphism was not associated with risk of prostate cancer (T versus C, OR = 1.14, 95 % CI 0.91-1.44, P = 0.26; TT versus CC, OR = 1.09, 95 % CI 0.67-1.76, P = 0.74; TT versus CC/CT: OR = 1.46, 95 % CI 0.67-3.18, P = 0.34; TT/CT versus CC, OR = 1.08, 95 % CI 0.82-1.43, P = 0.59). VEGF rs3025039 polymorphism was also not associated with risk of prostate cancer (T versus C, OR = 1.03, 95 % CI 0.91-1.16, P = 0.66; TT versus CC, OR = 1.82 95 % CI 0.16-20.53, P = 0.63; TT versus CC/CT, OR = 2.00, 95 % CI 0.18-22.41, P = 0.57; TT/CT versus CC, OR = 0.72, 95 % CI 0.38-1.36, P = 0.31).

With the increasing success rate of cancer treatments and longer life expectancy of the treated patients, the issue of secondary cancer incidence is of growing concern, especially for paediatric patients who may live long after the treatment and be more susceptible to carcinogenesis. Also, additional imaging procedures like computed tomography, kilovoltage and megavoltage imaging and positron emission tomography, alone or in conjunction with radiation therapy, may add to the radiation burden associated with the risk of occurrence of secondary cancers. This work has been based on literature studies and is focussed on the assessment of secondary doses to healthy tissues that are delivered by the use of modern radiation therapy and diagnostic imaging modalities in the clinical environment.",

        "abstract": "Most of merkel cell carcinomas (MCC), a rare, aggressive skin cancer with neuroendocrine features, harbor merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV). Seroepidemiological studies suggested high prevalence of MCPyV in the human population. More than ten sequence data on MCPyV strains in Japan have been available, whereas most sequence data were detected from patients living in Europe or European ancestry. Analysis of nine almost complete and 19 partial sequences from two oncogenes, small T antigen (ST) and large T antigen (LT) genomes obtained from 32 Japanese MCPyV-infected MCC revealed that each Japanese MCPyV-infected MCC harbored a specific MCPyV strain with some synonymous or, silent mutations and stop codons or deletions, but functional domains of T antigen had no amino acid changes. All stop codons were localized after retinoblastoma protein-binding domain. These Japanese MCPyV strains were very closely interrelated to themselves and a consensus sequence of Japanese strain was generated. Phylogenetic analysis of our nine sequences and 70 other sequences for ST and LT gene registered in GenBank indicated that Japanese or Asian MCPyV strains formed distinct clades from Caucasian clade, and phylogenetic tree of our nine and 75 other sequences for ST gene formed characteristic three clades and showed that all Japanese or Asian strains were included in the dominant clade. These suggested the possibility of geographically related genotypes of MCPyV. The genomic characterization of MCPyV variants will provide an important database and insights for illuminating their evolutional and biological differences.",

        "abstract": "Brain metastases are a major clinical problem in patients with advanced breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma. Initial treatment for patients with brain metastases typically includes radiotherapy, either whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), or both. Surgical resection is generally reserved for good prognosis patients with limited/controlled extracranial metastases and a single brain lesion. Once patients progress through upfront treatment, the treatment approach is quite variable and there is no clearly defined standard-of-care. Over the past decade, the role of systemic therapies and in particular, targeted therapies has been increasingly explored in patients with brain metastases from solid tumors. For example, lapatinib has been studied as monotherapy, and in combination with capecitabine, in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, and activity has been observed in both the upfront and refractory settings. In patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), central nervous system (CNS) activity has been reported with gefinitib and erlotinib. Finally, in melanoma, the B-raf inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib, and the immunomodulator, ipilumimab, have reported CNS activity. Moving forward, the challenge will be to understand how to optimize the activity of targeted agents in the CNS and how to best incorporate them into the current treatment paradigms in order to improve outcomes for this patient population.",

Transfer of genes encoding target antigen-specific receptors enables polyclonal T cells to redirect toward cancer cells and virally infected cells expressing those defined antigens. Using this technology, a large population of redirected T cells displaying uniform therapeutic properties has been produced, powerfully advancing their clinical application as \"cellular drugs\" for adoptive immunotherapy against cancer. Clinically, anticancer adoptive immunotherapy using these genetically engineered T cells has an impressive and proven track record. Notable examples include the dramatic benefit of chimeric antigen receptor gene-modified T cells redirected towards B-cell lineage antigen CD19 in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and the impressive outcomes in the use of TCR gene-modified T cells redirected towards NY-ESO-1, a representative cancer-testis antigen, in patients with advanced melanoma and synovial cell sarcoma. In this review, we briefly overview the current status of this treatment option in the context of hematological malignancy, and discuss a number of challenges that still pose an obstacle to the full effectiveness of this strategy.",

        "abstract": "Current clinical problems in colorectal cancer diagnostics and therapeutics include the disease complexity, tumour heterogeneity and resistance to targeted therapeutics. In the present study, we examined 171 CRC adenocarcinomas from Greek patients undergoing surgery for CRC in order to determine the frequency of KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA point mutations from different areas of tumours in heterogeneous specimens. 92/171 (53.8%) patients were found to bear a KRAS mutation in codons 12/13. Of the 126 mutations found, 57.9% (73/126) were c.38G>A mutations (p.G13D) and 22.2% (28/126) c.35G>T (p.G12V). Remarkably, RAS mutations in both codons 12 and 13 were recorded in the same tumour by Pyrosequencing. Moreover, differences in KRAS mutations between tumour centre and periphery revealed tumour heterogeneity in 50.7% of the specimens. BRAF c.1799T>A (V600E) mutations were moderately detected in 4/171 (2.3%) specimens, while most PIK3CA mutations were revealed by Pyrosequencing 6/171 (3.5%). Remarkable tumour heterogeneity is revealed, where double mutations of KRAS in the same tumour and different KRAS mutation status between tumour core and margin are detected with high frequency. It is expected that these findings will have a major impact in cancer diagnosis and personalised therapies. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

The dual-hit hypothesis proposed by Braak implicates the enteric nervous system as an initial site of α-synuclein aggregation with subsequent spread to the central nervous system. Regional variations in the spatial pattern or levels of α-synuclein along the enteric nervous system could have implications for identifying sites of onset of this pathogenic cascade. We performed immunohistochemical staining for α-synuclein on gastrointestinal tissue from patients with no history of neurological disease using the established LB509 antibody and a new clone, MJFR1, characterized for immunohistochemistry here. We demonstrate that the vermiform appendix is particularly enriched in α-synuclein-containing axonal varicosities, concentrated in its mucosal plexus rather than the classical submucosal and myenteric plexuses. Unexpectedly, intralysosomal accumulations of α-synuclein were detected within mucosal macrophages of the appendix. The abundance and accumulation of α-synuclein in the vermiform appendix implicate it as a candidate anatomical locus for the initiation of enteric α-synuclein aggregation and permits the generation of testable hypotheses for Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. © 2013 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

        "abstract": "Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a highly aggressive B-cell lymphoma resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Although defined by the characteristic t(11;14) translocation, MCL has not been recapitulated in transgenic mouse models of cyclin D1 overexpression alone. Indeed, a variety of genetic aberrations have been identified in MCL that may contribute to its pathogenesis and chemoresistance. Of particular interest is the frequent biallelic deletion of the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein BIM. BIM exerts its pro-death function via its alpha-helical BH3 death domain that has the dual capacity to inhibit anti-apoptotic proteins such as BCL-2 and MCL-1 and directly trigger pro-apoptotic proteins such as the mitochondrial executioner protein BAX. To evaluate a functional role for Bim deletion in the pathogenesis of MCL, we generated cyclin D1 transgenic mice harboring Bim-deficient B-cells. In response to immunization, Eμ(CycD1)CD19(CRE)Bim(fl/fl) mice manifested selective expansion of their splenic mantle zone compartment. Three distinct immune stimulation regimens induced lymphomas with histopathologic and molecular features of human MCL in a subset of mice. Thus, deletion of Bim in B-cells, in the context of cyclin D1 overexpression, disrupts a critical control point in lymphoid maturation and predisposes to the development of MCL. This genetic proof-of-concept for MCL pathogenesis suggests an opportunity to reactivate the death pathway by pharmacologic mimicry of pro-apoptotic BIM.",

        "abstract": "This study investigated the association between IL-27 gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to epithelial ovarian cancer in a Chinese population and discusses the risk factors associated with survival time. We collected data on 229 patients diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer, from 15 to 77 years of age with a long clinical follow-up period. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism was performed to determine the genotype of IL-27 gene polymorphisms. Ovarian cancer-specific survival (OCSS) according to genotype of IL-27 gene polymorphisms was explored by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modeling. Significant differences for genotype frequencies of both SNP sites were found between cases and controls. Both allele G frequencies were significantly greater among the cases (rs153109: 0.404 vs. 0.303, P = 0.001, odds ratio [OR] = 1.333, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.133-1.567; rs17855750: 0.146 vs. 0.083, P = 0.001, OR = 1.766, 95% CI = 1.258-2.481). Haplotype analysis showed haplotypes AG, GT and GG were associated with increased ovarian cancer susceptibility while AT was a protective haplotype. Advanced FIGO stage (stages III + IV) and non-optimal cytoreductive surgery (residual tumor ≥1 cm) were poor prognostic factors in the univariate analysis (P = 0.003, P = 0.049). However, FIGO stage was found to be the only independent significant prognostic factor by Cox proportional hazards analysis (P = 0.042). IL-27p28 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in ovarian cancer patients (P < 0.0001), while no significant relationship was found between IL-27p28 mRNA expression and polymorphism of rs153109 and rs17855750 (P = 0.193 and P = 0.146, respectively). Our study suggests that IL-27 gene polymorphisms may be involved in the susceptibility to epithelial ovarian cancer, but not in survival in a clinic-based Chinese population. Haplotype analysis of these two SNPs seems to be an important mark to predict the disease susceptibility. Advanced FIGO stage, as the only significant, independent risk factor, predicts poor clinical outcomes for patients diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer. The decreased expression of IL-27p28 mRNA in ovarian cancer might indicate the antitumor activities of this novel cytokine.",

While it is disappointing that cures are relatively rare, this should not detract from the value of these agents to cancer patients and the opportunity they provide in allowing us to gain a deeper understanding of drug response and resistance. These insights have already provided the basis for the evaluation of alternative dosing regimens and combination therapies in melanoma patients.",

However, these procedures are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Available data investigating the outcomes of HIPEC are mostly limited to single-center studies. To date, there have been few large-scale studies investigating the postoperative outcomes of HIPEC. OBJECTIVE To determine the associated 30-day morbidity and mortality of cytoreductive surgery-HIPEC in the treatment of metastatic and primary peritoneal cancer in American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program centers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective review of HIPEC cases performed for primary and metastatic peritoneal cancer diagnoses was conducted. The cytoreductive surgical procedures were sampled, and disease processes were identified. Patient demographics, intraoperative occurrences, and postoperative complications were reviewed from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2005-2011. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Thirty-day mortality and morbidity. RESULTS Of the cancers identified among the 694 sampled cases, 14% of patients had appendiceal cancer, 11% had primary peritoneal cancer, and 8% had colorectal cancer. The American Society of Anesthesiologists classification was 3 for 70% of patients. The average operative time was 7.6 hours, with 15% of patients requiring intraoperative transfusions. Postoperative bleeding (17%), septic shock (16%), pulmonary complications (15%), and organ-space infections (9%) were the most prevalent postoperative complications. The average length of stay was 13 days, with a 30-day readmission rate of 11%. The rate of reoperation was 10%, with an overall mortality rate of 2%. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program hospitals performing HIPEC have acceptable rates of morbidity and mortality.",

We used modified maximum likelihood to explore the effects of outcome misclassification on the rate ratio of lung cancer death per 100 fiber-years per milliliter of cumulative asbestos exposure in a cohort study of textile workers in Charleston, South Carolina, followed from 1940 to 2001. The standard covariate-adjusted estimate of the rate ratio was 1.94 (95% confidence interval: 1.55, 2.44), and modified maximum likelihood produced similar results when we assumed that the specificity of outcome classification was 0.98. With sensitivity assumed to be 0.80 and specificity assumed to be 0.95, estimated rate ratios were further from the null and less precise (rate ratio = 2.17; 95% confidence interval: 1.59, 2.98). In the present context, standard estimates for the effect of asbestos on lung cancer death were similar to estimates accounting for the limited misclassification. However, sensitivity analysis using modified maximum likelihood was needed to verify the robustness of standard estimates, and this approach will provide unbiased estimates in settings with more misclassification.",

        "abstract": "It has been recently shown that chestwall recurrence of breast cancer and many other superficial diseases can be successfully treated with the combination of radiation, chemotherapy and hyperthermia. Conformal microwave antenna array for hyperthermia treatment of large area superficial diseases can significantly increase patient comfort while at the same time facilitate treatment of larger and more irregularly shaped disease. A large number of small efficient antennas is preferable for improved control of heating, as the disease can be more accurately contoured and the lower power requirement correlates with system reliability, linearity and reduced cost. Thus, starting from the initially proposed square slot antennas, we investigated new designs for multi-fed slot antennas of several shapes that maximize slot perimeter while reducing radiating area, thus increasing antenna efficiency. Simulations were performed with commercial electromagnetic simulation software packages (Ansoft HFSS) to demonstrate that the antenna size reduction method is effective for several dual concentric conductor (DCC) aperture shapes and operating frequencies. The theoretical simulations allowed the development of a set of design rules for multi-fed DCC slot antennas that facilitate conformal heat treatments of irregular size and shape disease with large multi-element arrays. Independently on the shape, it is shown that the perimeter of 10cm at 915 MHz delivers optimal radiation pattern and efficiency. While the maximum radiation is obtained for a circular pattern the rectangular shape is the one that feels more efficiently the array space.",

This study evaluates these drugs in combination in metastatic breast cancer. Taxane-naive patients with HER-2 negative, stage IV breast cancer without prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease, were eligible. Docetaxel (60 mg/m(2)) was given intravenously on Day 1, vinorelbine (27.5 mg/m(2)) intravenously on Days 8 and 15, and filgrastim on Days 2-21 of a 21-day cycle. The primary study outcome was one-year overall survival (OS), with secondary outcomes of progression-free survival (PFS), response rate (RR), and toxicity. Of 95 patients registered, 92 were eligible and received treatment. One-year OS was 74 % (95 % CI 64-82 %) with a median OS of 22.3 months (95 % CI 18.8-31.4 months). One-year PFS was 34 % (95 % CI 24-43 %) with median of 7.2 months (95 % CI 6.4-10.3). OS at 2 and 3 years were 49 % (95 % CI 38-59 %) and 30 % (95 % CI 21-40 %), respectively. OS was poorer for women with estrogen-receptor negative disease (n = 32) compared to estrogen-receptor positive (n = 60) (log-rank p = 0.031), but PFS was not significantly different (p = 0.11). RR was 59 % among the 74 patients with measurable disease. Grade 3 and 4 adverse events were 48 and 16 %, respectively. Grade 4 neutropenia was 12 % and grade 3/4 febrile neutropenia was 3 %. Common grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxicities were fatigue (14 %), pneumonitis (10 %), and dyspnea (9 %). The combination of docetaxel and vinorelbine is an active first-line chemotherapy in HER-2 nonoverexpressing, metastatic breast cancer. This combination is associated with significant hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity. The safety profile and expense of the filgrastim limit recommendations for routine use.",

We report here that PAK6 is specifically required for carcinoma cell-cell dissociation downstream of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) for both DU145 prostate cancer and HT29 colon cancer cells. Moreover, PAK6 overexpression can drive cells to escape from adhesive colonies in the absence of stimulation. We have localized PAK6 to cell-cell junctions and have detected a direct interaction between the kinase domain of PAK6 and the junctional protein IQGAP1. Co-expression of IQGAP1 and PAK6 increases cell colony escape and leads to elevated PAK6 activation. Further studies have identified a PAK6/E-cadherin/IQGAP1 complex downstream of HGF. Moreover, we find that β-catenin is also localized with PAK6 in cell-cell junctions and is a novel PAK6 substrate. We propose a unique role for PAK6, independent of AR signaling, where PAK6 drives junction disassembly during HGF-driven cell-cell dissociation via an IQGAP1/E-cadherin complex that leads to the phosphorylation of β-catenin and the disruption of cell-cell adhesions.",

        "abstract": "Metastatic breast cancer is linked to an undesired prognosis. One early and crucial metastatic step is the interaction of cancer emboli with adjacent stroma or endothelial cells, and understanding the mechanisms of this interaction provides the basis to define new targets as well as drugs for therapy and disease management. A three-dimensional (3D) co-culture model allowing the examination of lymphogenic dissemination of breast cancer cells was recently developed which facilitates not only the study of metastatic processes but also the testing of therapeutic concepts. This 3D setting consists of MCF-7 breast cancer cell spheroids (representing a ductal and hormone-dependent subtype) and of hTERT-immortalised lymph endothelial cell (LEC; derived from foreskin) monolayers. Tumour spheroids repel the continuous LEC layer, thereby generating \"circular chemorepellent-induced defects\" (CCIDs) that are reminiscent to the entry gates through which tumour emboli intravasate lymphatics. We found that the ion channel blocker carbamazepine (which is clinically used to treat epilepsy, schizophrenia and other neurological disorders) inhibited CCID formation significantly. This effect correlated with the inhibition of the activities of NF-κB, which contributes to cell motility, and with the inactivation of the mobility proteins MLC2, MYPT1 and FAK which are necessary for LEC migration. NF-κB activity and cell movement are prerequisites of CCID formation. On the other hand, the expression of the motility protein paxillin and of the NF-κB-dependent adhesion mediator ICAM-1 was unchanged. Also the activity of ALOX12 was unaffected. ALOX12 is the main enzyme synthesising 12(S)-HETE, which then triggers CCID formation. The relevance of the inhibition of CYP1A1, which is also involved in the generation of mid-chain HETEs such as 12(S)-HETE, by carbamazepine remains to be established, because the constitutive level of 12(S)-HETE did not change upon carbamazepine treatment. Nevertheless, the effect of carbamazepine on the inhibition of CCID formation as an early step of breast cancer metastasis was significant and substantial (~30 %) and achieved at concentrations that are found in the plasma of carbamazepine-treated adults (40-60 μM). The fact that carbamazepine is a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration facilitates a \"from-bench-to-bedside\" perspective. Therefore, the here presented data should undergo scrutiny in vivo.",

        "abstract": "DNA Damage Response (DDR) that evolved to repair host cell DNA damages also recognizes viral DNA entering the nucleus during infections. Here, we investigated the modulation of DDR signaling during de novo infection of primary endothelial cells by KSHV. Phosphorylation of representative DDR-associated proteins such as Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) and H2AX were induced as early as 30 min (0.5h) post infection which persisted during in vitro KSHV latency. Phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX) colocalized at 30 min (0.5h) with the KSHV genome entering the nuclei. Total H2AX protein levels also increased which is attributed to a decrease in degradative H2AX Lys 48-linked polyubiquitination with concomitant increase in Lys 63-linked polyubiquitination that is shown to increase protein stability. ATM and H2AX phosphorylation and γH2AX nuclear foci were also induced by UV-inactivated KSHV which ceased at later times of infection. Inhibition of ATM kinase activity by KU55933 and H2AX knockdown by siRNA significantly reduced the expression of KSHV latency associated nuclear antigen (ORF 73; LANA-1) and LANA-1 nuclear puncta. Knockdown of H2AX also resulted in >80% reduction in the nuclear KSHV DNA copy numbers. Similar results were also observed in ATM (-) cells although comparable levels of viral DNA entered the ATM (-) and ATM (+) cell nuclei. In contrast, knockdown of CHK1 and CHK2 did not affect ORF73 expression. Collectively, these results demonstrated that KSHV induces ATM and H2AX, a selective arm of the DDR, for the establishment and maintenance of its latency during de novo infection of primary endothelial cells.",

        "abstract": "Antigen persistence in chronic infections and cancer up-regulates inhibitory networks, such as the PD-1 and IL-10 pathways, that impair immunity and lead to disease progression. These pathways are attractive targets for immunotherapy, as demonstrated by recent clinical trials of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in cancer patients. However, in HIV-1 infection not all subjects respond to inhibition of either pathway and the mechanistic interactions between these two networks remain to be better defined. Here we demonstrate that in vitro blockade of PD-L1 and/or IL-10Rα results in markedly different profiles of HIV-1-specific CD4 T cell restoration. Whereas PD-L1 blockade leads to balanced increase in IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-13 secretion, IL-10Rα blockade preferentially restores IFN-γ production. In viremic subjects, combined PD-L1/IL-10Rα blockade results in a striking 10-fold increase in IFN-γ secretion by HIV-1-specific CD4 T cells that is not observed in subjects with spontaneous (elite controllers) or therapy-induced control of viral replication. In contrast to the dramatic increase in IFN-γ, concurrent blockade has a marginal additive effect on IL-2 production, IL-13 secretion and HIV-1-specific CD4 T cell proliferation. IFN-γ produced by Thelper cells up-regulates PD-L1, HLA I/II and IL-12 expression by monocytes. The effect of combined blockade on IFN-γ was dependent on reciprocal reinforcement through IL-12. These studies provide crucial information on the different immunoregulatory qualities of PD-1 and IL-10 in progressive disease, and link exhausted virus-specific CD4 T cells and monocytes in the regulation of IFNγ and IL-12 secretion.",

To address these issues, suitable reference strains are needed that are representative of the global epidemic. Several panels have been recommended previously but no clear answers have been available on how many and which strains are best suited for this purpose. We used a statistical model-selection method to identify a global panel of reference Env clones from among 219 Env-pseudotyped viruses assayed in TZM-bl cells with sera from 205 HIV-1-infected individuals. The Envs and sera were sampled globally from diverse geographic locations and represented all major genetic subtypes and circulating recombinant forms of the virus. Assays with a panel size of only nine viruses adequately represented the spectrum of HIV-1 serum neutralizing activity seen with the larger panel of 219 viruses. An optimal panel of nine viruses was selected and augmented with three additional viruses for greater genetic and antigenic coverage. The spectrum of HIV-1 serum neutralizing activity seen with the final twelve-virus panel closely approximated the activity seen with subtype-matched viruses. Moreover, the final panel was highly sensitive for detecting many of the known broadly neutralizing antibodies. For broader assay applications, all twelve Env clones were converted to infectious molecular clones using a proviral backbone encoding a Renilla luciferase reporter gene (Env.IMC.LucR viruses). This global panel should facilitate highly standardized assessments of vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies across multiple HIV-1 vaccine platforms in different parts of the world.",

Referral letters for 734 patients were collected. The proposed diagnoses were compared with definitive diagnosis made by dermatologists. In 44.5%, lesions appeared to be benign. Malignant skin tumours were poorly recognised by GPs and seborrheic keratoses were often mistaken for naevi (33.6%). Furthermore, with total body examination, dermatologists found 111 additional malignant lesions. We discussed several recommendations to minimise unnecessary referrals as well as the future role of GPs in skin cancer care.",

        "abstract": "Impaired programmed cell death is an important contributing mechanism in the development of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Overexpression of Bcl-2 family proteins in such diseases has led to the concept of targeted suppression of these proteins as a primary therapeutic strategy. However, limited success with this approach has prompted pharmacologists to look at the other side of the coin, with the aim of reactivating jeopardized pro-apoptotic proteins that may neutralize Bcl-2 or other anti-apoptotic molecules. In this effort, BH3-only proteins have gained recent attention as endogenous molecules for the sensitization of resistant cells to undergo apoptosis. Among the BH3-only family, Noxa stands out as exceptional for its specificity to bind Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 and blunt their biological properties. Noxa is now being tested as a promising therapeutic target in cancer biology. Nonetheless, its role and clinical application still lack validation in autoimmune diseases, including rheumatic conditions. This is partly attributed to the significant gap in our understanding of its regulatory role and how either overexpression of Noxa or delivery of BH3 mimetics could be therapeutically exploited. In this review we highlight some recent studies in RA, OA, SLE and SS suggesting that Noxa may be used as a potential therapeutic target to circumvent invasive and tissue destructive processes in these rheumatic diseases.",

To address this question, we used a nonhuman primate challenge model with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). We show that antibodies to the SIV envelope are necessary and sufficient to prevent infection. Moreover, sequencing of viruses from breakthrough infections revealed selective pressure against neutralization-sensitive viruses; we identified a two-amino-acid signature that alters antigenicity and confers neutralization resistance. A similar signature confers resistance of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies against variable regions 1 and 2 (V1V2), suggesting that SIV and HIV share a fundamental mechanism of immune escape from vaccine-elicited or naturally elicited antibodies. These analyses provide insight into the limited efficacy seen in HIV vaccine trials.",

The clinical, cytogenetic and outcome features of HeH among adolescents and adults have not been thoroughly investigated. Among 1232 B-cell precursor ALL patients (15-65 years) treated on UKALLXII/ECOG2993, 160 (13%) had a HeH karyotype, including 80 patients aged >24 years. The frequency of HeH was the same in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) positive and negative cases, but Ph-positive patients were older. The cytogenetic profiles of Ph+ and Ph- HeH cases were similar, although trisomy 2 was strongly associated with Ph+ HeH. Overall Ph+ HeH patients did not have an inferior overall survival compared with Ph- patients, P=0.2: 50% v 57% at 5 years. Trisomy of chromosome 4 was associated with a superior outcome in Ph- patients; whereas +5 and +20 were associated with an inferior outcome in Ph+ and Ph- patients, respectively. All three markers retained significance in multivariate analysis adjusting for age and white cell count: hazard ratio for risk of death 0.47 (95% CI 0.27-0.84), P=0.01, 3.73 (1.51-9.21), P=0.004 and 2.63 (1.25-5.54), P=0.01 respectively. In conclusion, HeH is an important subtype of ALL at all ages and displays outcome heterogeneity according to chromosomal gain.Leukemia accepted article preview online, 19 December 2013. doi:10.1038/leu.2013.379.",

        "abstract": "Albuminuria is a well-documented predictor of cardiovascular (CV) mortality. However, day-to-day variability is substantial, and there is no consensus on the number of urine samples required for risk prediction. To resolve this we followed 9158 adults from the population-based Nord-Trøndelag Health Study for 13 years (Second HUNT Study). The predictive performance of models for CV death based on Framingham variables plus 1 versus 3 albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) was assessed in participants who provided 3 urine samples. There was no improvement in discrimination, calibration, or reclassification when using ACR as a continuous variable. Difference in Akaike information criterion indicated an uncertain improvement in overall fit for the model with the mean of 3 urine samples. Criterion analyses on dichotomized albuminuria information sustained 1 sample as sufficient for ACR levels down to 1.7 mg/mmol. At lower levels, models with 3 samples had a better overall fit. Likewise, in survival analyses, 1 sample was enough to show a significant association to CV mortality for ACR levels above 1.7 mg/mmol (adjusted hazard ratio 1.37; 95% CI 1.15-1.63). For lower ACR levels, 2 or 3 positive urine samples were needed for significance. Thus, multiple urine sampling did not improve CV death prediction when using ACR as a continuous variable. For cutoff ACR levels of 1.0 mg/mmol or less, additional urine samples were required, and associations were stronger with increasing number of samples.Kidney International advance online publication, 18 December 2013; doi:10.1038/ki.2013.500.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE Targeted BRAF inhibitor therapy (vemurafenib, dabrafenib) is an effective, novel treatment for patients with metastatic melanoma with the V600E BRAF mutation. This therapy is associated with squamous cell carcinomas and keratoacanthomas. Granulomatous eruptions have not been previously reported. OBSERVATIONS Two patients with melanoma developed cutaneous granulomatous eruptions during targeted BRAF inhibitor therapy. In case 1, after 2 months of treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib (MEK inhibitor), a papular eruption concerning for progression of disease prompted cessation of treatment. After the histopathologic diagnosis of granulomas, the patient was treated with clobetasol ointment with resolution within days and resumption of therapy. In case 2, after 5 months of vemurafenib treatment, the patient developed a granulomatous eruption, which resolved 3 weeks after cessation of therapy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE We report 2 cases of cutaneous granulomatous eruptions on treatment with targeted BRAF inhibitors, a previously unreported association. Although additional investigations are necessary to better elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms, our report includes a treatment plan that prevents unnecessary discontinuation of therapy. Given the Food and Drug Administration approval of vemurafenib for metastatic melanoma, clinicians should be aware of this possible cutaneous reaction and treatment option to optimize patient management.",

However significant strides have been made over the past few years with respect to understanding the pathophysiology as well as treatment modalities. The use of local therapies, particularly gene therapy, has been evaluated, but have yet to make a major clinical impact on treatment of GBM. In a study published by Westphal and colleauges in The Lancet, the use of sitimagene ceradenovec, a first generation replication-deficient adenovirus containing a prodrug converting enzyme, herpes-simplex virus thymidine kinase, followed by intravenous ganciclovir administration and standard therapy was evaluated compared with standard therapy alone. Patients who received sitimagene ceradenovec had improved time to death or re-intervention, but did not show improvement in overall survival. Patients receiving sitimagene ceradenovec experienced more adverse effects related to treatment, including seizures and hyponatremia. While further studies need to be conducted to determine clinical significance, gene therapy appears to be a viable approach for patients who may be resistant to chemotherapy.",

LGL lymphocytosis is caused by a proliferation of cytotoxic (CD8(+)) T cells and/or NK cells. In a proportion of CML and Ph(+) ALL patients, there is a significant expansion of LGLs during dasatinib therapy. LGL lymphocytosis is seen in some cases with fevers, colitis, and pleural effusions (PE), suggesting an aberrant immune response mediated by these LGLs. LGLs may participate in the elimination of the residual leukemic cells, and LGL clonal expansion is associated with excellent, long-lasting therapy responses in dasatinib-treated patients.

        "abstract": "Aims: Triptolide is a diterpenoid epoxide isolated from the herb Tripterygium wilfordii, which has long been used as a natural medicine in China for many diseases including cancer. However, its effect on liver cancer has not yet been evaluated. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of triptolide on liver cancer cell lines. Materials and Methods: The effect of triptolide with cancer chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin and fluorouracil (5-FU) in vitro and in vivo on liver cancer cells has been investigated. Cell viability and protein expression were determined by MTT assay and Western blotting respectively. Aoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by flow cytometry. The antitumor effects of triptolide alone or in combination were also measured in transplantation tumor models. Results: The combination of triptolide plus chemotherapeutics (Cisplatin, 5-FU) reduced cancer cell viability and enhanced apoptosis compared with single treatment in vitro. Furthermore, cells treated with triptolide plus chemotherapeutics exhibited marked production of intracellular ROS and caspase-3 activity compared with single treatment, which paralleled the incidence of apoptosis. Triptolide and chemotherapeutics treatment also induced Bax expression, and inhibited Bcl-2 expression. Triptolide also boosted the anticancerous effects of cisplatin and 5-FU in nude mice compared with cisplatin or 5-FU alon treated tumors. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that triptolide is associated with increased cellular sensitivity of liver cancer cells to cisplatin and 5-FU in vivo and in vitro, and may provide new liver cancer treatment strategies.",

Materials and Methods For the human study, five cancer patients received local radiation therapy. Bone marrow aspiration was conducted to measure nucleated cell count and 99mTc-Sc sulfur colloid ECT imaging was carried out to examine bone marrow function. For the animal study, fifty New Zealand white rabbits were divided into 3 groups: non-irradiated control group (n=10), abdomen irradiation group (irradiation area did not cover bone marrow) (n=20), chest irradiation group (irradiation area covered bone marrow) (n=20). Nucleated cell counts were taken after confirming onset of leukopenia. Results Bone marrow of five patients proliferated normally. ECT imaging showed no abnormality in the pattern of red bone marrow distribution. Hematopoietic function was mildly active. Conclusion Suppressed myeloproliferative function does not fully account for irradiation-induced leukopenia.",

Results: The survey response rate was 56.4 per cent. All symptoms had some degree of psychological impact for the majority of participants; hearing loss was the symptom most often reported to have a severe psychological impact. The majority of respondents reported functional impact attributed to hearing loss, balance disturbance, dizziness, eye problems, headache and fatigue; balance disturbance was the symptom most often reported to have a severe functional impact. For most symptoms, psychological and functional impact were related to severity and frequency. Conclusion: Of the acoustic neuroma symptoms investigated, hearing loss and balance disturbance were the most likely to have a severe psychological and functional impact, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Preoperative chemoradiotherapy has emerged in the treatment of esophageal cancer as a means to down-stage tumors, improve local control, and possibly improve overall survival. However, there are concerns that postoperative complications may be increased by preoperative chemoradiotherapy. We review the rationale for preoperative chemoradiotherapy. We review the literature to identify the potential postoperative complications, the risk of complications, and the risk factors for complications. Although individual and previous studies have shown an increased risk of postoperative complications, the 4 most recent randomized trials published after the year 2000 have not shown an increase in postoperative complications and mortality rates in patients treated with preoperative chemoradiation compared with patients treated with surgery alone. Pulmonary complications are frequently reported, and we focus on dosimetric factors that can be used to minimize lung toxicity. Several dose-volume-histogram parameters, including V10≥40%, V15≥30%, V20≥20%, have been shown to correlate with 32% to 35% of pulmonary complications including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. More recent evidence has suggested that an absolute volume of lung spared doses of > 5 Gy (VS5) correlates with pulmonary complications. As these data show, low-dose volume may be more important in the prevention of pulmonary complications than high-dose volume. These dosimetric constraints can be used by physicians to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications in patients treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy.",

Perhaps best exemplified in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including inhibitors of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase and JAK2, have dramatically changed outcomes in persons with MPN. However, clinically relevant dosing of these adenosine triphosphate-mimetic agents in humans leads to inhibition of numerous tyrosine kinases beyond those touted by drug manufacturers and studied in landmark clinical trials. These so-called off-target effects have been linked to both clinical efficacy and toxicity. Rational drug development and serendipitous discovery of drug molecules allows the clinician to select targeted oncolytic agents to treat a specific clinical diagnosis and/or avoid exacerbation of concomitant disease states due to effects upon signaling pathways. Understanding the off-target binding and effects upon signaling pathway of the agents approved for the treatment of MPN will empower the clinician to adroitly select pharmacotherapy, predict toxicities, and utilize these agents in clinical practice for indications beyond MPN.",

        "abstract": "Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a heterogeneous group of rare tumors. They are often slow-growing and patients can have very long survival, even at the metastatic stage. The evaluation of tumor progression and therapeutic responses is currently based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors v1.1 (RECIST) criteria. As for other malignancies, RECIST criteria warrant being revisited in the era of targeted therapies, because tumor response to targeted therapies is rarely associated with shrinkage, as opposed to prolonged progression-free survival. Therefore, size-based criteria no longer seem suited to the assessment of NET progression and therapeutic responses, especially considering targeted therapies. New imaging criteria, combining morphological and functional techniques have proven relevant for other malignancies treated with targeted therapies. To date, such studies have rarely been conducted on NETs. Moreover, optimizing the management of NET patients also requires considering clinical, biological and pathological aspects of tumor evolution. Our objectives herein were to comprehensively review current knowledge on the assessment of tumor progression and early prediction of therapeutic responses, and to broaden the outlook on well-differentiated NETs, in the era of targeted therapies.",

        "abstract": "Small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (SI-NETs), formerly midgut carcinoids, are rare and slow-growing neoplasms. Frequent loss of one copy of chromosome 18 in primary tumors and metastases has been observed. The aim of the study was to investigate a possible role of TCEB3C (Elongin A3), currently the only imprinted gene on chromosome 18, as a tumor suppressor gene in SI-NETs, and whether its expression is epigenetically regulated. Primary tumors, metastases, the human SI-NET cell line CNDT2.5, and two other cell lines were included. Immunohistochemistry, gene copy number determination by PCR, colony formation assay, Western blotting, real-time quantitative RT-PCR, RNA interference, and quantitative CpG methylation analysis by pyrosequencing were performed. The large majority of tumors (33/43) showed very low to undetectable Elongin A3 expression and as expected 89% (40/45) displayed one TCEB3C gene copy. The DNA hypomethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine induced TCEB3C expression in CNDT2.5 cells, in primary SI-NET cells prepared directly after surgery, but not in two other cell lines. Also siRNA to DNMT1 and treatment with the general histone methyltransferase inhibitor 3-deazaneplanocin A induced TCEB3C expression in a cell type-specific way. CpG methylation at the TCEB3C promoter was observed in all analyzed tissues and thus not related to expression. Overexpression of TCEB3C resulted in a 50% decrease of clonogenic survival of CNDT2.5 cells, but not of control cells. The results support a putative role of TCEB3C as a tumor suppressor gene in SI-NETs. Epigenetic repression of TCEB3C seems to be tumor cell type-specific and involves both DNA and histone methylation.",

LN metastasis has similarity to circulating lymphocytes homing to LNs, but the role of HEVs in the progression of oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is unclear. In this study, we found that HEVs experienced a series of morphological and functional changes during OPSCC progression and were correlated with LN metastasis. In 9 cases of 73 metastatic LNs, tumor emboli were located adjacent to HEVs or just out of the vessels but not lymphatic channels. Gap junctions of tumor cells close to HEVs decreased or disappeared, and gaps were left at contact points where tumor cells attached to the HEVs. Moreover, the proliferation rate of endothelial cells of HEVs was the highest in metastatic LNs. Finally, L-selectin was detected in both primary and metastatic tumors, and it facilitated tumor cells adhering to LNs. In conclusion, our findings suggest that remodeled HEVs are correlated with LN metastasis of OPSCC and play important role in this process by preparing premetastatic soil for cancer cell metastasis.",

        "abstract": "Cellular senescence is characterized by silencing of genes involved in DNA replication and cell cycle progression. Stable repression is crucial for preventing inappropriate DNA synthesis and the maintenance of a prolonged senescent state. Many of these genes are targets for E2F transcription factors. The pRB pathway plays a major role in senescence by directly repressing E2Fs and also by regulating chromatin at the promoters of E2F target genes using its LXCXE cleft-dependent interactions. In this study, we sought to investigate the mechanisms by which pRB stably silences E2F target gene transcription during cellular senescence. We report that in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, endogenous promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) associates with E2F target genes in a pRB LXCXE-dependent manner during HrasV12-induced senescence. Furthermore, using a PML-IV-induced senescence model, we show that the pRB LXCXE binding cleft is essential for PML association with gene promoters, silencing of E2F target genes, and stable cell cycle exit. Binding assays show that pRB can interact with PML specifically during senescence, suggesting that signaling events in senescence regulate assembly of PML and pRB to establish heterochromatin and create a permanent cell cycle arrest.",

        "abstract": "Trimodality therapy consisting of high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (NHT) and adjuvant hormonal therapy (AHT) has been used to treat localized high-risk prostate cancer. In this study, an analysis of patients receiving the trimodality therapy was performed to identify prognostic factors of biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS). Between May 2005 and November 2008, 123 high-risk prostate cancer patients (D'Amico classification) were treated with NHT prior to HDR brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated EBRT. Among these patients, 121 had completed AHT. The patients were assigned by time to be treated with a low-dose or high-dose arm of HDR brachytherapy with subsequent hypofractionated 3D conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT). Multivariate analysis was used to determine prognostic factors for bRFS. With a median follow-up of 60 months, the 5-year bRFS for all patients was 84.3% (high-dose arm, 92.9%; low-dose arm, 72.4%, P = 0.047). bRFS in the pre-HDR PSA ≤ 0.1 ng/ml subgroup was significantly improved compared with that in the pre-HDR PSA > 0.1 ng/ml subgroup (88.3% vs 68.2%, P = 0.034). On multivariate analysis, dose of HDR (P = 0.045, HR = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.038-0.97) and pre-HDR PSA level (P = 0.02 HR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.18-10.16) were significant prognostic factors predicting bRFS. In high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with the trimodality therapy, the dose of HDR and pre-HDR PSA were significant prognostic factors. The pre-HDR PSA ≤ 0.1 subgroup had significantly improved bRFS. Further studies are needed to confirm the relevance of pre-HDR PSA in trimodality therapy.",

        "abstract": "Clear cell RCC is the most common, and more likely to metastasize, of the three main histological types of RCC. Pathologic stage is the most important prognostic indicator and nuclear grade can predict outcome within stages of localized RCC. Epithelial tumors are thought to accumulate a series of genetic and epigenetic changes as they progress through well-defined clinical and histopathological changes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the regulation of mRNA expression from many human genes and miRNA expression is dysregulated in cancer. To better understand the contribution of dysregulated miRNA expression to the progression and biology of ccRCC, we examined the differences in expression levels of 723 human miRNAs through a series of analyses by stage, grade, and disease progression status in a large series of 94 ccRCC. We found a consistent signature that included significant upregulation of miR-21-5p, 142-3p, let-7g-5p, let-7i-5p and 424-5p, as well as downregulation of miR-204-5p, to be associated with ccRCC of high stage, or high grade, or progression. Discrete signatures associated with each of stage, grade, or progression were also identified. The let-7 family was significantly downregulated in ccRCC compared with normal renal parenchyma. Expression of the 6 most significantly differentially expressed miRNAs between ccRCC was verified by stem-loop qRT-PCR. Pathways predicted as targets of the most significantly dysregulated miRNAs included signaling, epithelial cancers, metabolism, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Our studies help to further elucidate the biology underlying the progression of ccRCC and identify miRNAs for potential translational application.",

        "abstract": "K-RAS mutated (K-RASmut) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells are resistant to EGFR targeting strategies. We investigated the impact of K-RAS activity irrespective of mutational status in the EGFR-independent increase in clonogenic cell survival. An analysis of the K-RAS activity status revealed a constitutively high K-RAS activity in K-RASmut NSCLC cells and also in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells overexpressing wild-type K-RAS (K-RASwt). Similar to K-RAS-mutated cells, increased K-RAS activity in HNSCC cells overexpressing K-RASwt was associated with the stimulated production of the EGFR ligand amphiregulin and resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK) inhibitors such as erlotinib. Expression of mutated K-RAS stimulated Akt phosphorylation and increased plating efficiency. Conversely, knockdown of K-RAS in K-RASmut NSCLC cells and in HNSCC cells presenting overexpression of K-RASwt resulted in sensitization to the anti-clonogenic activity of erlotinib. K-RAS activity results in EGFR-dependent and EGFR-independent Akt activity. The short-term treatment (2 h) of cells with EGFR-TK or PI3K inhibitors (erlotinib and PI-103) resulted in the repression of Akt activation, whereas long-term treatment (24 h) with inhibitors led to the reactivation of Akt and improved clonogenicity. The Akt re-activation was MAPK-ERK2-dependent and associated with a lack of complete response to anti-clonogenic activity of PI-103. A complete response was observed when PI-103 was combined with MEK inhibitor PD98059. Together, clonogenicity inhibition in tumor cells presenting constitutive K-RAS activity independent of K-RAS mutational status can be achieved by targeting of EGFR downstream pathways, i.e., PI3K alone or the combination of PI3K and MAPK inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "The present studies determined whether the antibiotic salinomycin interacted with HDAC inhibitors to kill primary human GBM cells. Regardless of PTEN, ERBB1, or p53 mutational status salinomycin interacted with HDAC inhibitors in a synergistic fashion to kill GBM cells. Inhibition of CD95/Caspase 8 or of CD95/RIP-1/AIF signaling suppressed killing by the drug combination. Salinomycin increased the levels of autophagosomes that correlated with increased p62 and LC3II levels; valproate co-treatment correlated with reduced LC3II and p62 expression, and increased caspase 3 cleavage. Molecular inhibition of autophagosome formation was protective against drug exposure. The drug combination enhanced eIF2α phosphorylation and decreased expression of MCL-1 and phosphorylation of mTOR and p70 S6K. Activation of p70 S6K or mTOR promoted cell survival in the face of combined drug exposure. Overexpression of BCL-XL or c-FLIP-s was protective. Collectively our data demonstrate that the lethality of low nanomolar concentrations of salinomycin are enhanced by HDAC inhibitors in GBM cells and that increased death receptor signaling together with reduced mitochondrial function are causal in the combinatorial drug necro-apoptotic killing effect.",

Several studies have assessed the benefit of maintenance therapy following platinum-based first-line therapy, to improve disease control, and thus, progression-free and overall survival with minimal toxicity and maintenance or improvement of quality of life of patients. We review here clinical trials evaluating continuation maintenance therapy or switch maintenance therapy in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, to highlight the achievements made and critical issues faced. Based on the available results and limitations of these trials, maintenance therapy should be considered a good treatment strategy for a limited subgroup of patients. Maintenance therapy should be personalised according to the characteristics of patients and their disease, taking into account the data available for the agents used in this setting.",

Among the hallmarks of cancer the disturbed immunosurveillance and cancer immune evasion have become emerging targets for cancer therapy. Due to their pleiotropic functions immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) are interesting agents for combination therapies in solid tumors. However, their possible contribution and a way of monitoring their biological effects have yet to be revealed. In a heavily pretreated patient with advanced colorectal cancer carrying mutations in APC and KRAS genes, we show an early metabolic response and enhanced NK cell activity to monotherapy with lenalidomide. After subsequent lenalidomide/cetuximab combination treatment, the patient had progressive disease. At the same time a reduced performance status, complicated by febrile neutropenia, occurred, as well as a slight increase in metabolic activity and NK cell activity droped back to baseline. Thus, laboratory measurements and metabolic response assessment correlated with clinical conditions. This case report describes the feasibility and potential of a functional assessment of patient derived immune competent cells in combination with functional imaging for the detection of a biological response.",

An increasing proportion of the burden is falling on low-income and middle-income countries because of not only demographic change but also a transition in risk factors, whereby the consequences of the globalisation of economies and behaviours are adding to an existing burden of cancers of infectious origin. We argue that primary prevention is a particularly effective way to fight cancer, with between a third and a half of cancers being preventable on the basis of present knowledge of risk factors. Primary prevention has several advantages: the effectiveness could have benefits for people other than those directly targeted, avoidance of exposure to carcinogenic agents is likely to prevent other non-communicable diseases, and the cause could be removed or reduced in the long term-eg, through regulatory measures against occupational or environmental exposures (ie, the preventive effort does not need to be renewed with every generation, which is especially important when resources are in short supply). Primary prevention must therefore be prioritised as an integral part of global cancer control.",

Although this statement was a useful inspiration for enlistment of resources, despite extraordinary progress in our understanding of disease pathogenesis, in most cases and for most forms of cancer this war has not been won. A second metaphor was about magic bullets-targeted therapies based on knowledge of mechanisms that were envisaged to strike with devastating consequences for the disease. The reality, however, is that targeted therapies are generally not curative or even enduringly effective, because of the adaptive and evasive resistance strategies developed by cancers under attack. In this Series paper, I suggest that, much like in modern warfare, the war on cancer needs to have a battlespace vision.",

When wild-type KISS1 metastasis suppressor is expressed, aerobic glycolysis decreases and oxidative phosphorylation predominates. However, when KISS1 is missing the secretion signal peptide (ΔSS), invasion and metastasis are no longer suppressed and cells continue to metabolize using aerobic glycolysis. KISS1-expressing cells have 30-50% more mitochondrial mass than ΔSS-expressing cells, which is accompanied by correspondingly increased mitochondrial gene expression and higher expression of PGC1α, a master co-activator that regulates mitochondrial mass and metabolism. PGC1α-mediated downstream pathways (i.e. fatty acid synthesis and β-oxidation) are differentially regulated by KISS1, apparently reliant upon direct KISS1 interaction with NRF1, a major transcription factor involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. Since the downstream effects could be reversed using shRNA to KISS1 or PGC1α, these data appear to directly connect changes in mitochondria mass, cellular glucose metabolism and metastasis.",

        "abstract": "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is critical for the repair of DNA lesions induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, but its contribution in replicating cells is less clear. Here, we show that dual incision by NER endonucleases including XPF and XPG promotes the S-phase accumulation of the BRCA1 and Fanconi anemia (FA)-associated DNA helicase FANCJ to sites of UV-induced damage. In response to UV damage, FANCJ promotes RPA phosphorylation and the arrest of DNA synthesis following UV irradiation. Interaction defective mutants of FANCJ reveal that BRCA1 binding is not required for FANCJ localization, whereas interaction with the mismatch repair (MMR) protein MLH1 is essential. Correspondingly, we find that FANCJ, its direct interaction with MLH1, and the MMR protein MSH2 function in a common pathway in response to UV irradiation. FANCJ deficient cells are not sensitive to killing by UV irradiation, yet we find that mutations are significantly enhanced. Thus, we considered that FANCJ deficiency could be associated with skin cancer. Along these lines, in melanoma we found several somatic mutations in FANCJ some of which were previously identified in hereditary breast cancer and Fanconi anemia (FA). Given that mutations in XPF can also lead to FA, we propose collaborations between FA, NER and MMR are necessary to initiate checkpoint activation in replicating human cells to limit genomic instability.",

Through metabolomic profiling using a combination of high-throughput liquid and gas chromatography-based mass spectrometry on a total of 69 patient derived glioma specimens, this report documents the discovery of a parallel pathway involving cysteine catabolism that results in the accumulation of cysteine sulfinic acid (CSA) in glioblastoma. These studies identified CSA to rank as one of the top metabolites differentiating glioblastoma from low-grade glioma. There was strong intra-tumoral concordance of CSA levels with expression of its biosynthetic enzyme cysteine dioxygenase 1 (CDO1). Studies designed to determine the biologic consequence of this metabolic pathway identified its capacity to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation in glioblastoma cells, which was determined by decreased cellular respiration, decreased ATP production, and increased mitochondrial membrane potential following pathway activation. CSA-induced attenuation of oxidative phosphorylation was attributed to inhibition of the regulatory enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase. Studies performed in vivo abrogating the CDO1/CSA axis using a lentiviral mediated shRNA approach resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition in a glioblastoma mouse model, supporting the potential for this metabolic pathway to serve as a therapeutic target. Collectively, we identified a novel, targetable metabolic pathway involving cysteine catabolism contributing to the growth of aggressive high-grade gliomas. These findings serve as a framework for future investigations designed to more comprehensively determine the clinical application of this metabolic pathway and its contributory role in tumorigenesis.",

We found that SIRT1 deficiency in MDSCs directs a specific switch to M1 lineage when cell enter the periphery from bone marrow, decreasing suppressive function in favor of a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype associated with tumor cell attack. Glycolytic activation through the mTOR-HIF1α pathway was required for differentiation to the M1 phenotype, which conferred protection against tumors. Our results define the essential nature of a SIRT1-mTOR/HIF1α glycolytic pathway in determining MDSC differentiation, with implications for metabolic reprogramming as a cancer therapeutic approach.",

To determine the significance of these mutations, we embarked upon a comprehensive study of NOTCH signaling in a cohort of 44 HNSCC tumors and 25 normal mucosal samples through a set of expression, copy number, methylation and mutation analyses. Copy number increases were identified in NOTCH pathway genes including the NOTCH ligand JAG1. Gene set analysis defined a differential expression of the NOTCH signaling pathway in HNSCC relative to normal tissues. Analysis of individual pathway-related genes revealed overexpression of ligands JAG1 and JAG2 and receptor NOTCH3. In 32% of the HNSCC examined, activation of the downstream NOTCH effectors HES1/HEY1 was documented. Notably, exomic sequencing identified 5 novel inactivating NOTCH1 mutations in 4/37 of the tumors analyzed, with none of these tumors exhibiting HES1/HEY1 overexpression. Our results revealed a bimodal pattern of NOTCH pathway alterations in HNSCC, with a smaller subset exhibiting inactivating NOTCH1 receptors mutations but a larger subset exhibiting other NOTCH1 pathway alterations, including increases in expression or gene copy number of the receptor or ligands as well as downstream pathway activation. Our results imply that therapies that target the NOTCH pathway may be more widely suitable for HNSCC treatment than appreciated currently.",

Whether the genetic variation within ROCKs-associated genes modulates IsST risk remains elusive. The association between 66 tag-SNPs (tSNPs) of 3 ROCKs-associated genes (ROCK1, ROCK2 and ARHGEF10) and incident IsST was investigated in 23,294 Caucasian female participants of the prospective Women's Genome Health Study. All were free of known cancer and cardiovascular disease at baseline. During a 15-year follow-up period, 323 participants developed a first ever IsST. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between genotypes and IsST risk assuming an additive genetic model. Haplotype-block analysis was also performed. A total of ten tSNPs were associated with IsST risk (three in ARHGEF10, and seven in ROCK1; all p<0.050). Further investigation using the haplotype-block analysis revealed similar significant association of pre-specified haplotypes of ROCK1 with IsST risk (p=0.005). If corroborated in other large prospective studies, the present findings suggest that genetic variation within the ROCKs-associated pathway gene loci examined, in particular, the ROCK1 gene variation may influence IsST risk.",

Although the discovery of novel biomarkers at the dawn of proteomics was a promising development, only a few identified biomarkers seemed to be beneficial for cancer patients. We may need to approach this issue differently, instead of only extending the conventional approaches that have been used historically. The study of biomarkers is essentially a study of diseases and the biochemistry relating to peptide, protein and post-translational modifications is only a tool. A problem-oriented approach should be needed in biomarker development. Clinician participation in the study of biomarkers will lead to realistic, practical and interesting biomarker candidates, which justify the time and expense involved in validation studies. Although discussion in this article is focused on cancer biomarkers, it can generally be applied to biomarker studies for other diseases.",

The ability to map specific compounds that have been determined to be biomarkers and therapeutic targets is relevant for the evaluation of the efficacy of targeted therapies. This article describes a new method called Spectro-ImmunoHistoChemistry (SIHC), which combines the use of specific antibodies against markers and mass spectrometric imaging in the MS/MS mode. SIHC is based on direct primary antibody-antigen recognition, trypsin digestion of the antibody overlaying the markers of interest in the tissue section, and MALDI-MSI of the tryptic peptides generated from the antibody. This approach has both clinical and pharmacological applications. First, it can be used as a cross-validation method to monitor the presence specifically of a marker in a tissue section. Second, SIHC could potentially be used as a novel technology for tracking specific antibodies after in vivo injection for anti-cancer treatments. Additionally, SIHC could enable novel clinical applications of MSI, such as monitoring the efficacy of cytotoxic antibody treatments.",

Participants explained that Somali women tended not to discuss breast cancer or breast cancer screening, and said religion played a central role in their care and treatment decisions and coping mechanisms. If such barriers are addressed, fewer women may present with late-stage breast cancer, resulting in greater chances for long-term breast cancer survival.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cancer diagnosed among men. In Spain the incidence of PCa was 70.75 cases per 100,000 males. Advanced PCa has spread outside of the prostate capsule and may involve other parts of the body. The aim of this study was to estimate the lifetime costs of a cohort of advanced PCa patients diagnosed in Spain in 2012. Methods: A partitioned economic model was developed in EXCEL incorporating Spanish incidence, mortality and cost data supplemented with data from the international literature. Progression from Stage III to Stage IV was permitted. Costs were discounted at the standard rate. Lifetime costs were presented on an individual basis and for the entire cohort of newly diagnosed Stage III and Stage IV PCa patients. Costs were discounted at 3%. Results: Lifetime costs for advanced PCa were approximately €19,961 per patient (mean survival of 8.4 years). Using the projected incident cases for 2012 (3,047), the total cost for the incident cohort of patients in 2012 would amount to €61 million. These results were more sensitive to changes in the ongoing costs (post initial 12 months) of Stage III PCa, the rate of progression from Stage III to Stage IV and the discount rate applied to costs. Conclusions: This study provides an estimate of the lifetime costs of advanced PCa in Spain and a framework for further research. The study is limited by the availability of long-term Spanish data and the need to make inferences from international studies. However, until long-term prospective or observational data do become available in Spain, based on the assumptions, the current results indicate that the burden of advanced PCa in Spain is substantial. Any treatments that could potentially reduce the economic burden of the disease should be of interest to health care decision makers.",

In the present work, we examined the ML peptide through detailed structure-activity relationship studies. A variety of ML-peptide analogues modified at the P8-P5 positions with leucine isomers (Nle, DLeu, and DNle) or substituted at the P1 position with arginine mimetics were tested for their inhibitory activity, specificity, stability, and antiproliferative effect. By incorporating d isomers at the P8 position or a decarboxylated arginine mimetic, we obtained analogues with an improved stability profile and excellent antiproliferative properties. The DLeu or DNle residue also has improved specificity toward PACE4, whereas specificity was reduced for a peptide modified with the arginine mimetic, such as 4-amidinobenzylamide.",

The present study was designed to isolate and characterize CTCs in peripheral blood of an early breast cancer (BC) patient as a biomarker for monitoring treatments efficacy. Materials and methods. In total, 54 early breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy regimens were enrolled into a prospective study. CTC detection in blood was performed by AdnaTest BreastCancer(™) (AdnaGen AG, Germany), which is based on the detection of EpCAM, HER2 and MUC1 specific transcripts in enriched CTC-lysates. Additionally, cDNA from isolated CTCs and PBMC was used for qPCR gene expression analysis of TOP1, TOP2A, CTSD, ST6, CK19 and reference gene actin. Results. We found that CTCs can be detected in the peripheral blood of approximately 31% of early stage breast cancer patients. The presence of CTCs was detected in 36% ER positive, 32% PR positive and 30% HER2 positive patients. We found no correlation between CTCs and tumor size, tumor grade, histological grade and receptor status. Only 7% of all patients remained CTCs positive after adjuvant therapy. Gene expression analysis revealed a particular heterogeneity of the studied genes. Conclusions. In conclusion, CTC detection may be a promising early marker of disease progression potentially enhancing the difficult therapeutic decisions. Further studies should, however, clearly demonstrate its utility for both the prediction of outcome and monitoring the effect of treatment.",

Moreover, second-generation proteasome inhibitors (carfilzomib) and immunomodulatory agents (pomalidomide) have recently been approved. Nevertheless, the incurability of this disease requires other drugs with different mechanisms of action to either prolong the survival of patients refractory to current therapies, or achieve cure. Active research has been done exploring the pathogenesis of MM and searching for novel, druggable targets. In this regard, some of these novel agents seem promising, such as monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD38 - daratumumab or anti-CS1 - elotuzumab) or the kinesin protein inhibitor Arry-520. Other agents under investigation are kinase inhibitors, signaling pathways inhibitors or deacetylase inhibitors. With so many novel agents under investigation, future therapy in MM will probably involve the combined use of the already approved drugs with some of those newly discovered.",

        "abstract": "Cellular senescence is the state of permanent inhibition of cell proliferation. Senescent cells are characterized by several features including increased activity of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-GAL) and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). In vitro 2 types of senescence have been described. One is telomere-dependent replicative senescence and the second is stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS). Despite some tissue-specific characteristics many kinds of cells, including stem/progenitor cells, can undergo senescence both in vitro and in vivo. Senescent cells were detected in murine, primate and human tissues using different markers. There is mounting evidence that senescent cells contribute to ageing and age-related disease by generating a low grade inflammation state (senescence-associated secretory phenotype-SASP). Even though cellular senescence is a barrier for cancer it can, paradoxically, stimulate development of cancer via proinflammatory cytokines. There is evidence that senescent vascular cells, both endothelial and smooth muscle cells, participate in atherosclerosis and senescent preadipocytes and adipocytes have been shown to lead to insulin resistance. Thus, modulation of cellular senescence is considered as a potential pro-longevity strategy. It can be achieved in several ways like: elimination of selected senescent cells, epigenetic reprogramming of senescent cells, preventing cellular senescence or influencing the secretory phenotype. Some pharmacological interventions have already been shown to have promising activity in this field.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Purpose: New understanding of cancer stem cell (CSC) biology continues to emerge due to development of novel methods in genomics and proteomics. Analysis of nucleic acids (RNA, DNA) is widely used to elucidate molecular perturbations in malignant tumors and carcinoma cells, however genome data do not reflect the functional activities of encoded proteins. Therefore proteome-based methods could enhance knowledge about deregulation of pathways as a result of altered expression and activities of proteins in CSC. Methods and Results: A sufficient number of CSC for proteomic analyses can be obtained in a variety of ways: fluorescence (FACS) and magnetic (MACS) activated cell sorting, laser cell capture microdissection, and three-dimensional spheroid/organoid cell culture. These methods to enrich and isolate CSC can be performed either with or without staining using antibodies against currently known CSC-specific cell surface molecules, such as clusters of differentiation 44, 24, 133 (CD44, CD24, CD133), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), aldehyde-dehydrogenase-1 (ALDH1), etc. The most important limitation on using antibody-based staining of CSC is that we still do not possess definitive CSC surface markers. This review article discusses methods that could be used to study protein profiling of CSC and to identify novel CSC-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Conclusion: Despite an opinion that the proteomic approach is time-consuming, laborious and difficult, this method can be used effectively to clarify which pathways are involved in regulating various intratumoral processes, including activation of CSC. Based on this point of view, searching and identification of single molecules as biomarkers or therapeutic targets could become possible when CSC-associated pathways are well described and clearly understood due to detailed investigation of the protein patterns in pre-clinical models and clinical samples.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Purpose: This study investigates whether the abscopal effect induced by radiation-therapy (RT) is able to sterilize non-irradiated tumour cells through bystander signals. Material and methods: Wild-type (wt)-p53 or p53-null HCT116 human colon cancer cells were xenografted into both flanks of athymic female nude mice. When tumours reached a volume of 0.2 cm(3), irradiation was performed, under strict dose monitoring, with a dedicated mobile accelerator designed for intra-Operative-RT (IORT). A dose of 10 or 20Gy (IR groups), delivered by a 10 MeV electron beam, was delivered to a tumour established in one side flank, leaving the other non irradiated (NIR groups). A subset of mice were sacrificed early on to carry out short-term molecular analyses. Results: All directly-irradiated tumours, showed a dose-dependent delayed and reduced re-growth, independent of the p53 status. Importantly, a significant effect on tumour-growth inhibition was also demonstrated in NIR wt-p53 tumours in the 20Gy-irradiation group, with a moderate effect also evident after 10Gy-irradiation. On the contrary, no significant difference was observed in the NIR p53-null tumours, independent of the dose delivered. Molecular analyses indicate that p53-dependent signals, might be responsible for the abscopal effect in our model system, via a pro-apoptotic pathway, Conclusions: We suggest that the interplay between delivered dose and p53 status might help to sterilize out-of-field tumour cells.",

We investigated mutations in the Src homology (SH) 2 domain of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) gene in Asian cohorts of T-LGL L and CLPD-NK (n = 42 and 11, respectively). Two mutations, Y640F and D661Y, were identified by direct sequencing or allele-specific (AS) PCR. Y640F and D661Y mutations were found in 7 and 18 patients, respectively. Two patients were positive for both mutations. Frequencies of STAT3 mutations in T-LGL L and CLPD-NK were 47.6% and 27.2%, respectively. Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) was associated with the mutations (P = 0.005). The mutations were persistently found at stable levels in some patients after more than five years by AS-quantitative PCR. Our results indicate that the SH2 domain of the STAT3 gene is frequently mutated in Asian T-LGL L and CLPD-NK, and that PRCA is closely correlated with the mutations.

        "title": "5-Lipoxygenase and CysLT1 regulate EGF-induced cell migration through Tiam1 upregulation and Rac1 activation.",
        "abstract": "Cell migration is an essential step for tumor metastasis. The small GTPase Rac1 plays an important role in cell migration. Previously, we reported that epidermal growth factor (EGF) induced two waves of Rac1 activation, namely, at 5 min and 12 h after stimulation. A second wave of EGF-induced Rac1 activation was required for EGF-induced cell migration. However, the spatiotemporal regulation of the second wave of EGF-induced Rac1 activation remains largely unclear. In this study, we found that 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) is activated in the process of EGF-induced cell migration, and that leukotriene C4 (LTC4 ) produced by 5-LOX mediated the second wave of Rac1 activation, as well as cell migration. Furthermore, these effects caused by LTC4 , were found to be blocked in the presence of the antagonist of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT1). This blockage indicates that LTC4 -mediated CysLT1 signaling regulates the second EGF-induced wave of Rac1 activation. We also found that 5-LOX inhibitors, CysLT1 antagonists, and the knockdown of CysLT1 inhibited EGF-induced T cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis-inducing protein 1 (Tiam1) expression. Tiam1 expression is required for the second wave of EGF-induced Rac1 activation in A431 cells. Therefore, our results indicate that the 5-LOX/LTC4 /CysLT1 signaling pathway regulates EGF-induced cell migration by increasing Tiam1 expression, leading to a second wave of Rac1 activation. Thus, CysLT1 may serve as a new molecular target for antimetastatic therapy. In addition, the CysLT1 antagonist, montelukast, which is clinically used for allergy treatment, might have great potential as a novel type of antimetastatic agent.

        "abstract": "The growth of blood vessels (angiogenesis) and lymphatic vessels (lymphangiogenesis) in and around solid tumors is central to the growth and metastatic spread of cancer. The therapeutic targeting of angiogenesis has become an established modality of cancer treatment, however, more comprehensive targeting of angiogenic signaling pathways may be required to enhance the clinical benefits of this approach. Angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis are driven, or modulated, by a range of secreted glycoproteins including vascular endothelial growth factors, platelet-derived growth factors, and transforming growth factor-β. These key regulatory growth factors are subject to proteolytic activation, involving highly specific cleavage events, which can occur at the cell surface or in the extracellular milieu. These cleavage events are catalysed by a variety of enzymes including proprotein convertases. This proteolysis can regulate the activity of these growth factors by enhancing binding affinities for cell surface receptors and co-receptors, or by altering their interactions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans, thereby modulating bioavailability. The proteolytic processing of these growth factors complicates strategies for targeting them for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes in cancer, as processing can generate various forms with distinct biological properties. Hence it has been important to determine which forms are biologically active for promoting angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in cancer, so as to indicate clinical relevance. Here we review the regulation of tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis by proteolytic activation of growth factors, and the potential therapeutic and diagnostic strategies arising from our understanding of this process.",

MiRNA modulates several pathways such as lipid uptake and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, implicating an involvement in plaque development.

        "abstract": "This study found that long-term exposure of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) K562 cells to BCR/ABL thyrosine kinase inhibirors (TKIs) caused drug-resistance in association with an increase in levels of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and a decrease in levels of microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-217. These observations are clinically relevant; an increase in levels of DNMT3A in association with downregulation of miR-217 were noted in leukemia cells isolated from individuals with BCR/ABL TKI-resistant philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph(+) ALL) and CML. Further studies with TKI-resistant K562 cells found that forced expression of miR-217 inhibited expression of DNMT3A through a miR-217-binding site within the 3'-untranslated region of DNMT3A and sensitized these cells to growth inhibition mediated by the TKI. Of note, long-term exposure of K562 cells to dasatinib (10 nM) together with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AzadC) (0.1 μM) potently inhibited proliferation of these cells in association with upregulation of miR-217 and downregulation of DNMT3A in vitro. In addition, a decrease in levels of DNMT3A and an increase in levels of miR-217 were noted in K562 tumors growing in immune deficient mice that were treated by the combination of 5-AzadC and dasatinib. Taken together, Ph(+) leukemia cells acquire TKI-resistance via downregulation of miR-217 and upregulation of DNMT3A. Inhibition of DNMT3A by forced expression of miR-217 or 5-AzadC may be useful to prevent drug resistance in individuals who receive TKIs. This article is protected by copyright.

Materials and Methods: The patient population of study was from the Premier Perspective Database (Premier, Inc., Charlotte, NC) and consisted of 71,312 radical prostatectomies performed at more than 300 U.S. hospitals by up to 3,739 surgeons by open or robotic techniques from 2004-2010. The key endpoints were surgery time, inpatient length of stay, overall complications. We compared open versus robotic, results by year of procedures, results by case volume of specific surgeons, and results of open surgery in hospitals with and without a robotic system Results: The mean surgery time was longer for RARP (4.4 hours, SD 1.7) compared to ORP (3.4 hours, SD 1.5) in the same hospitals, p<0.0001. Inpatient stay was shorter for RARP (2.2 days, SD 1.9) compared to ORP (3.2 days, SD 2.7) in the same hospitals, p< 0.0001. The overall complications were less for RARP (10.6%) compared to ORP (15.8%) in the same hospitals, as were transfusion rates. ORP results in hospitals without a robot were not better than ORP with a robot, and pre-treatment co-morbidity profiles were similar in all cohorts. Trending of results by year of procedure showed no differences in the 3 cohorts, but trending of RARP results by surgeon experience showed improvements in surgery time, hospital stay, conversion rates, and complication rates. Conclusions: During the initial seven years of RARP development, outcomes showed decreased hospital stay, complications, and transfusion rates. Learning curve trends for RARP were evident for these endpoints when grouped by surgeon experience, but not by year of surgery.",

        "abstract": "Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are currently delivered mainly via the intravenous route, since large volumes are often required to deliver a therapeutic dose. Administration via the subcutaneous route would have several therapeutic advantages, the absorption mechanisms for antibodies dosed subcutaneously are poorly understood. This study was conducted to develop a better understanding of the mechanisms governing the subcutaneous absorption and trafficking of monoclonal antibodies. Specifically, the role of the lymphatic system in the absorption and prolonged plasma exposure of trastuzumab was explored in thoracic lymph duct cannulated rats after SC and IV dosing. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed in S-ADAPT to simultaneously fit all plasma and lymph concentrations and to predict the pharmacokinetics in non-lymph-cannulated animals. The estimated absolute bioavailability of trastuzumab after SC administration in rats was 85.5%. Following SC administration, 53.1% of the trastuzumab dose was absorbed via a first-order process (mean absorption time: 99.6 h) into the peripheral lymph compartment and 32.4% of the dose was absorbed by a Michaelis-Menten process into the central compartment. Recovery in thoracic lymph over 30 h was 26.7% after SC and 44.1% after IV administration. This study highlights for the first time the significant role of the lymphatic system in maintaining the long plasma exposure of trastuzumab, with the model predicting an extensive distribution of this monoclonal antibody into the lymph following SC and IV administration. This extensive direct absorption from the SC injection site into lymph may enable novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of lymph resident metastatic cancer. ++",

        "abstract": "Abstract Immunotherapy is becoming an increasingly attractive therapeutic alternative for conventional cancer therapy. In recent years Foxp3(+) regulatory T-cells (TR) were identified as the major obstacle to effective cancer immunotherapy. The abundance of these cells in peripheral blood is increased in patients with multiple types of cancer and their prevalence among tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes correlated with poor clinical prognosis. In contrast, removal or inactivation of TR cells led to enhanced anti-tumor immune response and better efficacy of cancer vaccines. This study reports that Bone Morphogenic Protein Receptor 1α (BMPR1α, Alk-3) is expressed by activated effector CD4(+) and TR cells and modulates functions of both cell types. Bone Morphogenic Proteins (BMPs) belong to the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β family of cytokines that also include TGFβ and activins. BMPs play crucial roles in embryonic development, tissue differentiation and homeostasis, and development of cancer. It was demonstrated that BMPs and activins synergize with TGFβ to regulate thymic T-cell development, maintain TR cells, and control peripheral tolerance. Inactivation of BMPR1α in T-cells results in impaired thymic and peripheral generation of TR cells. BMPR1α-deficient activated T-cells produced a higher level of interferon (IFN)-γ than BMPR1α-sufficient T-cells. Moreover, transplanted B16 melanoma tumors grew smaller in mice lacking expression of BMPR1α in T-cells and tumors had few infiltrating TR cells and a higher proportion of CD8(+) T-cells than wild-type mice.",

        "abstract": "The sedative and antiemetic drug thalidomide [α-(N-phthalimido)glutarimide] was withdrawn in the early 1960s due to its potent teratogenic effects but was approved for the treatment of lesions associated with leprosy in 1998 and multiple myeloma in 2006. The mechanism of teratogenicity of thalidomide still remains unclear, but it is well established that metabolism of thalidomide is important for both teratogenicity and cancer treatment outcome. Thalidomide is oxidized by various cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes, the major being P450 2C19, to 5-hydroxy-, 5'-hydroxy-, and dihydroxythalidomide. We previously reported that P450 3A4 oxidizes thalidomide to the 5-hydroxy and dihydroxy metabolites, with the second oxidation step involving a reactive intermediate, possible an arene oxide, that can be trapped by glutathione (GSH) to GSH adducts. We now show that the dihydroxythalidomide metabolite can be further oxidized to a quinone intermediate. Human P450s 2J2, 2C18, and 4A11 were also found to oxidize 5-hydroxythalidomide to dihydroxy products. Unlike P450s 2C19 and 3A4, neither P450 2J2, 2C18, nor 4A11 oxidized thalidomide itself. A recently approved amino analog of thalidomide, pomalidomide (CC-4047, Actimid™), was also oxidized by human liver microsomes and P450s 2C19, 3A4, and 2J2 to the corresponding phthalimide ring-hydroxylated product.",

Areas covered: This article discusses preclinical and clinical studies supporting the use of remestemcel-L in aGvHD as well as the current regulatory status. This information was based upon a PubMed and Internet search. Expert opinion: Phase II studies suggest remestemcel-L may have clinical activity in aGvHD and confirm tolerability. However, these results must be interpreted cautiously with any use of remestemcel-L optimally occurring in the context of a clinical trial. Further clarity will be obtained when the results of a completed Phase III study are published. There is a small market for remestemcel-L in aGvHD. A possible future scenario is that a more prevalent indication is found and remestemcel-L is approved for that indication, but use continues for aGvHD.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Purpose: Optically activated nanoparticle-mediated heating for thermal therapy applications is an area of intense research. The ability to characterise the spatio-temporal heating potential of these particles for use in modelling under various exposure conditions can aid in the exploration of new approaches for therapy as well as more quantitative prospective approaches to treatment planning. The purpose of this research was to investigate an inverse solution to the heat equation using magnetic resonance temperature imaging (MRTI) feedback, for providing optical characterisation of two types of nanoparticles (gold-silica nanoshells and gold nanorods). Methods: The optical absorption of homogeneous nanoparticle-agar mixtures was measured during exposure to an 808 nm laser using real-time MRTI. A coupled finite element solution of heat transfer was registered with the data and used to solve the inverse problem. The L2 norm of the difference between the temperature increase in the model and MRTI was minimised using a pattern search algorithm by varying the absorption coefficient of the mixture. Results: Absorption fractions were within 10% of literature values for similar nanoparticles. Comparison of temporal and spatial profiles demonstrated good qualitative agreement between the model and the MRTI. The weighted root mean square error was <1.5 σMRTI and the average Dice similarity coefficient for ΔT = 5 °C isotherms was >0.9 over the measured time interval. Conclusion: This research demonstrates the feasibility of using an indirect method for making minimally invasive estimates of nanoparticle absorption that might be expanded to analyse a variety of geometries and particles of interest.",

        "abstract": "Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is a polymer commonly used for functionalization of drug molecules to increase their bloodstream lifetime, hence efficacy. However, the interactions between the PEGylated drugs and biomembranes are not clearly understood. In this study, we employed atomic-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to consider the behavior of two drug molecules functionalized with PEG (tetraphenylporphyrin used in cancer phototherapy, and biochanin A belonging to the isoflavone family) in the presence of a lipid bilayer. The commonly held view is that functionalization of a drug molecule with a polymer acts as an entropic barrier, inhibiting the penetration of the drug molecule through a cell membrane. Our results indicate that in the bloodstream there is an additional source of electrostatic repulsive interactions between the PEGylated drugs and the lipid bilayer. Both the PEG chain and lipids can bind Na+ ions, thus effectively becoming positively charged molecules. This leads to an extra repulsive effect resulting from the presence of salt in the bloodstream. Thus, our study sheds further light on the role of PEG in drug delivery.",

        "abstract": "Some authors have shown that the encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (E-FVPTC) has a better prognosis than encapsulated classic PTC [1, 2] and non-encapsulated FVPTC [3, 4].In patients with PTC restricted to the gland (i.e., without extrathyroid invasion or apparent metastases), lobectomy is considered sufficient for unifocal tumors ≤ 1 cm, whereas total thyroidectomy followed by (131) I ablation is recommended for tumors > 4 cm [5]. In the case of tumors > 1 cm and ≤ 4 cm, more aggressive initial therapy should be considered in the presence of vascular invasion [5]. Therefore, doubts remain regarding the treatment of intrathyroid PTC when the tumor measures 1 to 4 cm and does not exhibit vascular invasion. Since the hypothesis is that E-FVPTC is more indolent, it is important to know the evolution of patients with this histological subtype when treated less aggressively. To our knowledge, only two studies reported the long-term results of patients with E-FVPTC ≥ 1 cm and without vascular invasion who were treated only by lobectomy [1, 3].

We develop a pseudo-likelihood estimation procedure for model fitting and inference and establish the asymptotic properties of the estimators.

These vaccines effectively protect against two HPV types associated with 70% of cervical cancer cases. Despite this success, researchers continue to develop second-generation HPV vaccines to protect against more HPV types and allow increased uptake in developing countries. While a reformulated vaccine based on the current technology is currently in clinical trials, another strategy consists of targeting highly conserved epitopes in the minor capsid protein of HPV, L2. Vaccines targeting L2 induce broadly neutralizing antibodies, capable of blocking infection by a wide range of HPV types. Several vaccine designs have been developed to optimize the display of L2 epitopes to the immune system and to reduce the cost of manufacture and distribution. L2-based vaccines show considerable promise as a potential next-generation HPV vaccine.",

Therefore, the aim of present investigation was to develop and evaluate low HLB surfactant nanoemulsion of 5-FU for topical chemoprevention of skin cancer. Low HLB surfactant nanoemulsions were prepared by oil phase titration method. Thermodynamically stable nanoemulsions were characterized in terms of droplet size distribution, zeta potential, viscosity and refractive index. Selected formulations and control were subjected to in vitro skin permeation studies through rat skin using Franz diffusion cells. Optimized formulation F9 was subjected to stability and in vitro cytotoxic studies on melanoma cell lines. Enhancement ratio was found to be 22.33 in formulation F9 compared with control and other formulations. The values of steady state flux and permeability coefficient for formulation F9 were found to be 206.40 ± 14.56 µg cm(-2) h(-1) and 2.064 × 10(-2) ± 0.050 × 10(-2 )cm h(-1), respectively. Optimized formulation F9 was found to be physical stable. In vitro cytotoxicity studies on SK-MEL-5 cancer cells indicated that 5-FU in optimized nanoemulsion is much more efficacious than free 5-FU. From these results, it can be concluded that the developed nanoemulsion might be a promising vehicle for chemoprevention of skin cancer.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background: Racial disparities in breast cancer treatment among Medicare beneficiaries have been documented. This study aimed to determine whether racial disparities exist among white and black female Medicare beneficiaries in Alabama, an economically disadvantaged U.S. state. Methods: From a linked dataset of breast cancer cases from the Alabama Statewide Cancer Registry and fee-for-service claims from Medicare, we identified 2,097 white and black females, aged 66 years and older, who were diagnosed with stages 1-3 breast cancer from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2002. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were used to determine whether there were racial differences in initiating and completing National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice guideline-specific treatment. Results: Sixty-two percent of whites and 64.7% of blacks had mastectomy (p=0.27); 34.6% of whites and 30.2% of blacks had breast conserving surgery (BCS) (p=0.12). Among those who had BCS, 76.8% of whites and 83.3% of blacks started adjuvant radiation therapy (p=0.33) and they equally completed adjuvant radiation therapy (p=0.29). For women with tumors over 1 centimeter, whites and blacks were equally likely to start (16.1% of whites and 18.3% of black; p=0.34) and complete (50.6% of whites and 46.3% of black; p=0.87) adjuvant chemotherapy. There were still no differences after adjusting for confounders using GEE. However, differences were observed by area-level socioeconomic status (SES), with lower SES residents more likely to receive a mastectomy (odds ratio [OR]=1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.57) and initiate radiation after BCS (OR=2.24; 95% CI: 1.28-3.93). Conclusions: No racial differences were found in guideline-specific breast cancer treatment or treatment completion, but there were differences by SES. Future studies should explore reasons for SES differences and whether similar results hold in other economically disadvantaged U.S. states.",

Many pRB-binding proteins, which function in gene transcription or modulation of chromatin structure, harbor LXCXE motifs in their binding domain for pRB. In this study, we found that nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA), a mitotic spindle organizer, interacts with pRB through LSCEE sequences located in its C-terminal region. siRNA-mediated down-regulation of pRB caused aberrant distribution of NuMA and alignment of spindle microtubules in mitotic cells. Abnormal organization of spindle microtubules was also accompanied by misalignment of an over-expressed NuMA mutant (mut-NuMA) with a defect in pRB binding caused by an LSGEK mutation. The mut-NuMA-over-expressing cells showed lower potency for survival than wild-type NuMA (wt-NuMA)-over-expressing cells during 2 weeks of culture. Interestingly, knockdown of pRB reduced the population of wt-NuMA-over-expressing cells to the same level as mut-NuMA cells after 2 weeks. Taken together, pRB may have a novel function in regulating the mitotic function of NuMA and spindle organization, which are required for proper cell cycle progression.",

        "abstract": "The regenerative abilities and the immunosuppressive properties of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) make them potentially the ideal cellular product of choice for treatment of autoimmune and other immune mediated disorders. Although the usefulness of MSCs for therapeutic applications is in early phases, their potential clinical use remains of great interest. Current clinical evidence of use of MSCs from both autologous and allogeneic sources to treat autoimmune disorders confers conflicting clinical benefit outcomes. These varied results may possibly be due to MSC use across wide range of autoimmune disorders with clinical heterogeneity or due to variability of the cellular product. In the light of recent genome wide association studies (GWAS), linking predisposition of autoimmune diseases to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the susceptible genetic loci, the clinical relevance of MSCs possessing SNPs in the critical effector molecules of immunosuppression is largely undiscussed. It is of further interest in the allogeneic setting, where SNPs in the target pathway of MSC's intervention may also modulate clinical outcome. In the present review, we have discussed the known critical SNPs predisposing to disease susceptibility in various autoimmune diseases and their significance in the immunomodulatory properties of MSCs.",

        "abstract": "The measurement of serum tumor markers levels in breast cancer (BC) patients is an economic and noninvasive diagnostic assay frequently requested by clinical oncologists to get information about the presence or absence of disease as well as its evolution. Despite their wide use in clinical practice, there is still an intense debate between scientific organizations about the real usefulness for patient monitoring during followup as well as response to therapy evaluation in case of advanced BC. In this review, we want to highlight the current recommendations published by scientific organizations about the use of \"established\" BC serum markers (CEA, TPA, TPS, CIFRA-21, CA15-3, and s-HER2) in clinical oncology practice. Moreover, we will focus on recent papers evidencing the usefulness of tumor markers levels measurement as a guide for the prescription and diagnostic integration of molecular imaging exams such as those performed by hybrid 18-fluorofeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography with integrated computed tomography. This technology is nowadays able to detect early cancer lesions undetectable by conventional morphological imaging investigation and most likely responsible for increasing of serum tumor markers levels.",

        "abstract": "We hypothesize that the correlation between the radiation dose expressed as the biologically effective dose (BED) and the clinical endpoints will correlate better as the value of the α/β ratio is increased to >10 Gy, which theoretically minimizes the overestimation of the dose potency associated with the linear quadratic (LQ) formula in the setting of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A search was conducted in the PubMed electronic databases in August 2011. In the studies analyzed, increasing the α/β ratio is associated with an increase in the strength of the correlation between isocenter BED and local control, especially in the studies with median followup of ≥24 months, for which Spearman's correlation coefficients of 0.74-0.76 were achieved for α/β of 20 Gy, 30 Gy, and 50 Gy (P =  0.007-0.008). A trend toward statistical significance was observed for the correlation of isocenter BED and the 2-year overall survival when an α/β of 20 Gy was used approached statistical significance (P = 0.073). Our results suggest that an α/β > 10 Gy may be more appropriate for the prediction of dose response in the setting of lung SBRT.",

The immunoregulatory function of FOXP3 may hinder the induction of immune responses against cancer and infectious agents, and thus, development of inhibitors of its functions might give new therapeutic opportunities for these diseases. But also, FOXP3 is an important tumor suppressor factor in some types of cancers, and therefore, understanding the structure and function of FOXP3 is crucial to gaining insights into the development of FOXP3-targeted therapeutic strategies. FOXP3 homodimerize and likely form supramolecular complexes which might include hundreds of proteins which constitute the FOXP3 interactome. Many of the functions of FOXP3 are clearly regulated by the interactions with these cofactors contributing importantly on the establishment of Treg-cell signature. We summarize here the structural/functional information on this FOXP3 complex, to identify potential opportunities for the development of new strategies to modulate FOXP3 activity.",

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard treatment for metastatic prostate cancer and has been shown to improve median time to progression and median survival time. Research suggests that castrate-resistant clones may be present early in the disease process prior to the initiation of ADT. These clones are not susceptible to ADT and may even flourish when androgen-responsive clones are depleted. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a safe and efficacious method of treating clinically localized prostate cancer and metastases. In patients with a limited number of metastatic sites, SBRT may have a role in eliminating castrate-resistant clones and possibly delaying progression to castrate-resistant disease.",

        "title": "Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Cancer.",
        "abstract": "A mechanistic understanding of how mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to cell growth and tumorigenesis is emerging beyond Warburg as an area of research that is under-explored in terms of its significance for clinical management of cancer. Work discussed in this review focuses less on the Warburg effect and more on mitochondria and how dysfunctional mitochondria modulate cell cycle, gene expression, metabolism, cell viability, and other established aspects of cell growth and stress responses. There is increasing evidence that key oncogenes and tumor suppressors modulate mitochondrial dynamics through important signaling pathways and that mitochondrial mass and function vary between tumors and individuals but the significance of these events for cancer are not fully appreciated. We explore the interplay between key molecules involved in mitochondrial fission and fusion and in apoptosis, as well as in mitophagy, biogenesis, and spatial dynamics of mitochondria and consider how these distinct mechanisms are coordinated in response to physiological stresses such as hypoxia and nutrient deprivation. Importantly, we examine how deregulation of these processes in cancer has knock on effects for cell proliferation and growth. We define major forms of mitochondrial dysfunction and address the extent to which the functional consequences of such dysfunction can be determined and exploited for cancer diagnosis and treatment.",

        "title": "Beyond DNA Repair: Additional Functions of PARP-1 in Cancer.",
        "abstract": "Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) are DNA-dependent nuclear enzymes that transfer negatively charged ADP-ribose moieties from cellular nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide (NAD(+)) to a variety of protein substrates, altering protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. The most studied of these enzymes is poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), which is an excellent therapeutic target in cancer due to its pivotal role in the DNA damage response. Clinical studies have shown susceptibility to PARP inhibitors in DNA repair defective cancers with only mild adverse side effects. Interestingly, additional studies are emerging which demonstrate a role for this therapy in DNA repair proficient tumors through a variety of mechanisms. In this review, we will discuss additional functions of PARP-1 - including regulation of inflammatory mediators, cellular energetics and death pathways, gene transcription, sex hormone- and ERK-mediated signaling, and mitosis - and the role these PARP-1-mediated processes play in oncogenesis, cancer progression, and the development of therapeutic resistance. As PARP-1 can act in both a pro- and anti-tumor manner depending on the context, it is important to consider the global effects of this protein in determining when, and how, to best use PARP inhibitors in anticancer therapy.",

        "abstract": "Oxazaphosphorines, with the most representative members including cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and trofosfamide, constitute a class of alkylating agents that have a broad spectrum of anticancer activity against many malignant ailments including both solid tumors such as breast cancer and hematological malignancies such as leukemia and lymphoma. Most oxazaphosphorines are prodrugs that require hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes to generate active alkylating moieties before manifesting their chemotherapeutic effects. Meanwhile, oxazaphosphorines can also be transformed into non-therapeutic byproducts by various drug-metabolizing enzymes. Clinically, oxazaphosphorines are often administered in combination with other chemotherapeutics in adjuvant treatments. As such, the therapeutic efficacy, off-target toxicity, and unintentional drug-drug interactions of oxazaphosphorines have been long-lasting clinical concerns and heightened focuses of scientific literatures. Recent evidence suggests that xenobiotic receptors may play important roles in regulating the metabolism and clearance of oxazaphosphorines. Drugs as modulators of xenobiotic receptors can affect the therapeutic efficacy, cytotoxicity, and pharmacokinetics of coadministered oxazaphosphorines, providing a new molecular mechanism of drug-drug interactions. Here, we review current advances regarding the influence of xenobiotic receptors, particularly, the constitutive androstane receptor, the pregnane X receptor and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, on the bioactivation and detoxification of oxazaphosphorines, with a focus on cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide.",

RGB marking has emerged as an elegant approach for enabling such investigations. However, methods for automated image analysis continue to be lacking. Here, to address this, we created a number of different multicolored poly- and monoclonal cancer cell lines for in vitro and in vivo use. To classify these cells in large scale data sets, we subsequently developed and tested an automated algorithm based on hue selection. Our results showed that this method allows accurate analyses at a fraction of the computational time required by more complex color classification methods. Moreover, the methodology should be broadly applicable to both in vitro and in vivo analyses.",

A second round of iDCs and activated T cells was then administered to patients after the last radiation cycle. This complete regimen was repeated for new and recurring lesions after 6 weeks of follow-up. One year post therapy, outcome analyses were performed to evaluate treatment efficacy. Patients were grouped according to both the number and size of tumors and clinical parameters at treatment initiation, including recurrent disease after standard cancer therapy, Stage IV disease, and no prior therapy. Irrespective of prior treatment status, 23/37 patients with ≤ 5 neoplastic lesions that were ≤ 3 cm in diameter achieved complete responses (CRs), and 5/37 exhibited partial responses (PRs). Among 130 individuals harboring larger and more numerous lesions, CRs were observed in 7/74 patients that had received prior SCT and in 2/56 previously untreated patients. Some patients manifested immune responses including an increase in CD8(+)CD56(+) lymphocytes among circulating mononuclear cells in the course of treatment. To prospectively explore the therapeutic use of these cells, CD8(+) cells were isolated from patients that had been treated with cellular immunotherapy and IMRT, expanded in vitro, and injected into recurrent metastatic sites in 13 individuals who underwent the same immunoradiotherapeutic regimens but failed to respond. CRs were achieved in 34 of 58 of such recurrent lesions while PRs in 17 of 58. These data support the expanded use of immunoradiotherapy in advanced cancer patients exhibiting progressive disease.",

While the discipline has been successful with respect to identifying specific oncogenes and tumor suppressors involved in oncogenesis, it is also challenging our approach to managing patients suffering from this deadly disease. Specifically cancer genomics is driving clinical oncology to take a more molecular approach to diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment selection. We review here recent work undertaken in cancer genomics with an emphasis on translation of genomic findings. Finally, we discuss scientific challenges and research opportunities emerging from findings derived through analysis of tumors with high-depth sequencing.",

Aiming to fight cancer effectively, more than half patients use vitamins or herbs concurrently with conventional anticancer treatment. Flavonoids or polyphenols existing in vegetables, fruits and green tea are common plant pigments with antioxidant properties and considered acting as cancer preventing or anti-cancer agents. Recently it was found that some flavonoids and vitamin C in diet or supplements have antagonistic effect with the anti-cancer drug bortezomib. Bortezomib is a specific inhibitor for proteasome and is currently used for treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Despite its successful rates in treating multiple myeloma and other solid tumors, it is unable to kill leukemic cells in the blood. It was recently revealed that some flavonoids and vitamin C present in green leaves and green teas in the blood can neutralize bortezomib by directly interaction between two chemicals. Here we summarize why dietary flavonoids should be avoided in patients who take bortezomib as chemotherapeutic drug.",

        "abstract": "Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) regulate cellular homeostatic processes. EGFR activates downstream signaling cascades that promote tumor cell survival, proliferation and migration. Dysregulation of EGFR signaling as a consequence of overexpression, amplification and mutation of the EGFR gene occurs frequently in several types of cancers and many become dependent on EGFR signaling to maintain their malignant phenotypes. Consequently, concerted efforts have been mounted to develop therapeutic agents and strategies to effectively inhibit EGFR. However, limited therapeutic benefits to cancer patients have been derived from EGFR-targeted therapies. A well-documented obstacle to improved patient survival is the presence of EGFR-inhibitor resistant tumor cell variants within heterogeneous tumor cell masses. Here, we summarize the mechanisms by which tumors resist EGFR-targeted therapies and highlight the emerging role of microRNAs (miRs) as downstream effector molecules utilized by EGFR to promote tumor initiation, progression and that play a role in resistance to EGFR inhibitors. We also examine evidence supporting the utility of miRs as predictors of response to targeted therapies and novel therapeutic agents to circumvent EGFR-inhibitor resistance mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "There are notable differences in the incidence and mortality rates for prostate cancer between Asia and Western countries. It is also recognized that there are differences in thinking with regard to treatment options. Recently it is also the case that opinions have been reported concerning the differences between Asian and Western patients with regard to their reaction to androgen depletion therapy (ADT). Given that ADT is a method of treatment that focuses on the elimination of testosterone, an inevitable symptom of its administration is testosterone losing syndrome. It is for this reason that in Western countries ADT has only been recommended in cases of advanced or metastatic cancer. On the other hand, in Asia, ADT is used in relatively many cases, including non-metastatic localized cancer and invasive localized cancer. To date, however, there has been little substantive discussion concerning this difference in utilization of ADT. ADT-related drugs for prostate cancer and the development of new drugs for castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) have been actively tested in recent years. It could be the case that analyzing the differences in concepts about ADT between Asia and the West could contribute to the effective use of ADT-related drugs and also help to build new treatment strategies for prostate cancer.",

Analytical methods to specifically evaluate biomarkers predictive of therapeutic efficacy have not been developed. Two randomized phase III trials of carboplatin-based chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC were used for learning and validating the predictive value of ERCC1 in situ protein levels, as measured by accurate quantitative analysis (AQUA). A novel Bayesian method was applied to identify the outcome-based threshold in the learning trial only. Overall survival (OS) was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis with log rank testing to determine statistical significance in the validating trial. For patients treated with gemcitabine and carboplatin, the median OS was 9.5 months (95% CI 6.7 to 11.8) for the high ERCC1 group compared to 15.6 months (95% CI 11.6 to 24.8) for the low ERCC1 group in the validation trial (log rank p-value = 0.007). The hazard ratio for low ERCC1 was 0.598 (95% CI, 0.394 to 0.908; p = 0.016) relative to high ERCC1 adjusted for age, sex, and histology.",

We synthesized four new peptides {Ac-GGNle-CCEHdFRWC-NH2, Ac-GGNle-CCEHdFRWCRP-NH2, Ac-CCEHdFRWC-NleGG-NH2 and Ac-CCEHdFRWCRP-NleGG-NH2} and determined their melanocortin-1 (MC1) receptor binding affinities in B16/F1 melanoma cells. Then we further examined the biodistribution properties of (99m)Tc-Ac-GGNle-CCEHdFRWCRP-NH2 and (99m)Tc-Ac-CCEHdFRWCRP-NleGG-NH2 in B16/F1 melanoma-bearing C57 mice. Overall, the Arg-Pro motif was critical for retaining low nanomolar MC1 receptor binding affinity. The deletion of the -RP- moiety dramatically reduced the receptor binding affinities of the peptides. The N-terminus was a better position than C-terminus for the -GGNle- moiety in retaining the lower renal and liver uptake. High melanoma uptake coupled with fast urinary clearance of (99m)Tc-Ac-GGNle-CCEHdFRWCRP-NH2 provided a new insight into the design of new α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) peptides.",

Mapping the upstream and downstream connectivity within the JNK network reveals an enrichment of bi-fan and feed-forward network motifs formed immediately upstream and downstream of JNK. In addition, negative feedback loops also exist through transcriptional activation of phosphatases that target the JNK pathway. The combinations of these motifs allow flexibility and tunability in signal integration and processing within the JNK network and may confer the wide range of biological responses that can be regulated by JNK activation.

        "abstract": "Ionizing radiation, like a variety of other cellular stress factors, can activate or down-regulate multiple signaling pathways, leading to either increased cell death or increased cell proliferation. Modulation of the signaling process, however, depends on the cell type, radiation dose, and culture conditions. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway transduces signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus in response to a variety of different stimuli and participates in various intracellular signaling pathways that control a wide spectrum of cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, and stress responses, and is known to have a key role in cancer progression. Multiple signal transduction pathways stimulated by ionizing radiation are mediated by the MAPK superfamily including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK. The ERK pathway, activated by mitogenic stimuli such as growth factors, cytokines, and phorbol esters, plays a major role in regulating cell growth, survival, and differentiation. In contrast, JNK and p38 MAPK are weakly activated by growth factors but respond strongly to stress signals including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1, ionizing and ultraviolet radiation, hyperosmotic stress, and chemotherapeutic drugs. Activation of JNK and p38 MAPK by stress stimuli is strongly associated with apoptotic cell death. MAPK signaling is also known to potentially influence tumor cell radiosensitivity because of their activity associated with radiation-induced DNA damage response. This review will discuss the MAPK signaling pathways and their roles in cellular radiation responses.",

These sites had previously been demonstrated to be essential for the stimulation of c-Jun activity and for cooperation with Ha-ras in oncogenic transformation. This led to the idea that JNK was a positive regulator of cellular transformation. However, the analysis of jnk gene deletion in various mouse models of cancer has produced conflicting findings, with some studies supporting the pro-oncogenic function of JNK and others providing evidence that JNK acts as a tumor suppressor. This review will discuss how these unexpected findings have increased our understanding of the role of JNK signaling in cancer and have provided a source of new working hypotheses.",

        "abstract": "Deregulation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling occurs frequently in a variety of human cancers, yet the exact role(s) of JNK deregulation in cancer cell biology remains to be fully elucidated. Our recent demonstration that the activity of JNK is required not only for self-renewal of glioma stem cells but also for their tumor initiation has, however, identified a new role for JNK in the control of the stemness and tumor-initiating capacity of cancer cells. Significantly, transient JNK inhibition was sufficient to cause sustained loss of the tumor-initiating capacity of glioma stem cells, suggesting that the phenotype of \"lost tumor-initiating capacity\" may be as stable as the differentiated state and that the tumor-initiating capacity might therefore be under the control of JNK through an epigenetic mechanism that also governs stemness and differentiation. Here, in this article, we review the role and mechanism of JNK in the control of this \"stemness-associated tumor-initiating capacity\" (STATIC), a new hypothetical concept we introduce in this review article. Since the idea of STATIC is essentially applicable to both cancer types that do and do not follow the cancer stem cell hypothesis, we also give consideration to the possible involvement of JNK-mediated control of STATIC in a wide range of human cancers in which JNK is aberrantly activated. Theoretically, successful targeting of STATIC through JNK could contribute to long-term control of cancer. Issues to be considered before clinical application of therapies targeting this JNK-STATIC axis are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "Disseminated cancer cells rely on intricate interactions among diverse cell types in the tumor-associated stroma, vasculature, and immune system for survival and growth. Ubiquitous expression of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (jnk) genes in various cell types permits their control of metastasis. In early stages of metastasis, JNKs affect tumor-associated inflammation and angiogenesis as well as tumor cell migration and intravasation. Within the tumor stroma, JNKs are essential for the release of growth factors that promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumor cells. JNK3, the least ubiquitous isoform, facilitates angiogenesis by increasing endothelial cell migration. Importantly, JNK expression in tumor cells integrates stromal signals to promote tumor cell invasion. However, JNK isoforms differentially regulate migration toward the endothelial barrier. Once tumor cells enter the bloodstream, JNKs increase circulating tumor cell (CTC) survival and homing to tissues. By promoting fibrosis, JNKs improve CTC attachment to the endothelium. Once anchored, JNKs stimulate EMT to facilitate tumor cell extravasation and enhance the secretion of endothelial barrier disrupters. Tumor cells attract barrier-disrupting macrophages by JNK-dependent transcription of macrophage chemoattractant molecules. In the secondary tissue, JNKs are instrumental in the premetastatic niche and stimulate tumor cell proliferation. JNK expression in cancer cells stimulates tissue-remodeling macrophages to improve tumor colonization. However, in T-cells, JNKs alter cytokine production that increases tumor surveillance and inhibits the recruitment of tissue-remodeling macrophages. Therapeutically targeting JNKs for metastatic disease is attractive considering their promotion of metastasis; however, specific JNK tools are needed to determine their definitive actions within the context of the entire metastatic cascade.",

Shortly after this initial discovery, JNK activation was reported for a wider variety of DNA-damaging agents, including γ-irradiation and chemotherapeutic compounds. As the DNA damage response mechanisms were progressively uncovered, the mechanisms governing the activation of JNK upon genotoxic stresses became better understood. In particular, a recent set of papers links the physical breakage in DNA, the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, the secretion of TNF-α, and an autocrine activation of the JNK pathway. In this review, we will focus on the pathway that is initiated by a physical break in the DNA helix, leading to JNK activation and the resultant cellular consequences. The implications of these findings will be discussed in the context of cancer therapy with DNA-damaging agents.",

One of the main subgroups, the p38 MAP kinases, has been implicated in a wide range of complex biologic processes, such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell death, cell migration, and invasion. Dysregulation of p38 MAPK levels in patients are associated with advanced stages and short survival in cancer patients (e.g., prostate, breast, bladder, liver, and lung cancer). p38 MAPK plays a dual role as a regulator of cell death, and it can either mediate cell survival or cell death depending not only on the type of stimulus but also in a cell type specific manner. In addition to modulating cell survival, an essential role of p38 MAPK in modulation of cell migration and invasion offers a distinct opportunity to target this pathway with respect to tumor metastasis. The specific function of p38 MAPK appears to depend not only on the cell type but also on the stimuli and/or the isoform that is activated. p38 MAPK signaling pathway is activated in response to diverse stimuli and mediates its function by components downstream of p38. Extrapolation of the knowledge gained from laboratory findings is essential to address the clinical significance of p38 MAPK signaling pathways. The goal of this review is to provide an overview on recent progress made in defining the functions of p38 MAPK pathways with respect to solid tumor biology and generate testable hypothesis with respect to the role of p38 MAPK as an attractive target for intervention of solid tumors.",

        "abstract": "Androgen Receptor (AR) signaling is critically important during the development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa). The AR signaling is also important in the development of castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) where AR is functional even after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT); however, little is known regarding the transcriptional and functional regulation of AR in PCa. Moreover, treatment options for primary PCa for preventing the occurrence of CRPC is limited; therefore, novel strategy for direct inactivation of AR is urgently needed. In this study, we found loss of miR-34a, which targets AR, in PCa tissue specimens, especially in patients with higher Gleason grade tumors, consistent with increased expression of AR. Forced over-expression of miR-34a in PCa cell lines led to decreased expression of AR and prostate specific antigen (PSA) as well as the expression of Notch-1, another important target of miR-34a. Most importantly, BR-DIM intervention in PCa patients prior to radical prostatectomy showed reexpression of miR-34a, which was consistent with decreased expression of AR, PSA and Notch-1 in PCa tissue specimens. Moreover, BR-DIM intervention led to nuclear exclusion both in PCa cell lines and in tumor tissues. PCa cells treated with BR-DIM and 5-aza-dC resulted in the demethylation of miR-34a promoter concomitant with inhibition of AR and PSA expression in LNCaP and C4-2B cells. These results suggest, for the first time, epigenetic silencing of miR-34a in PCa, which could be reversed by BR-DIM treatment and, thus BR-DIM could be useful for the inactivation of AR in the treatment of PCa.[This corrects the article on p. 14 in vol. 4.].",

KDM4 expression is tightly regulated to insure proper function in diverse biological processes, such as cellular differentiation. Mounting evidence has shown that disrupting KDM4 expression is implicated in the establishment and progression of multiple diseases including cancer. In particular, genomic regions encoding the KDM4A, B and C genes are often amplified, disrupting normal cellular proliferation. Furthermore, KDM4 demethylases are promising druggable targets. In this review, we highlight the latest advances in characterizing the structures and regulatory mechanisms of KDM4 proteins, as well as our current understanding of their alterations and roles in tumorigenesis. We also review the reported KDM4 inhibitors and discuss their potential as therapeutic agents.",

Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were investigated by flow cytometry. In addition, the expression of several proteins associated with apoptosis and cell cycle were analyzed by western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that PD significantly inhibits the proliferation of A549 and NCI-H1975 lung cancer cell lines and causes dose-dependent apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis revealed that PD induces S phase cell cycle arrest. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of Bcl-2 decreased as that of Bax increased, and the expression of cyclin D1 was also suppressed.

Between January 2009 and June 2010, CNB was performed on 345 lung lesions in 343 patients. These patients were then followed up for at least two years. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the CNB diagnoses were calculated. The correlation between factors, such as smoking, positoin and maximal diameter, and the complications of pneumothorax and hemorrhage was analyzed by χ(2) test. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV and NPV of the CNB diagnoses were 97.3, 100, 97.7, 100 and 87.7%, respectively. A statistically significant correlation was found between pneumothorax and the factors of smoking (P=0.015) and position (P<0.01) and length of the needle in the normal parenchyma (P=0.011), as well as between hemorrhage and the maximal diameter (P=0.005) and length of the needle in the normal parenchyma (P<0.01) and the frequency of needle adjustments (P<0.01). A CT-guided core needle biopsy of the lung lesions provides a high diagnostic yield. Smoking, the decubitus position and a longer length of the needle in the normal parenchyma were found to represent risk factors for a pneumothorax. In addition, a small diameter and longer length of the needle in the normal parenchyma and a more frequent adjustment of the needle were poor predictive factors of hemorrhage.",

        "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is proposed to be an immunohistochemical surrogate of the basal-like breast cancer subtype. In spite of the relative chemosensitivity of this cancer subtype, it is characterized by aggressive clinical behavior; therefore, a further subclassification of TNBC is required to develop new targeted treatment. In previous studies, a strong correlation between BRCA1 mutation-associated tumors and TNBC has been identified. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic significance of carrying two germline BRCA1 founder mutations (4153delA and 5382insC) in patients with TNBC in the Latvian population. A total of 78 consecutive BRCA1 mutation-negative and 38 BRCA1 mutation-positive invasive TNBC patients in stage I-IV with no history of ovarian or other primary advanced cancers, who had undergone definitive surgery and genetic testing between 2005 and 2011, were deemed eligible for study. Relapse rates and breast cancer-specific survival (BCS) outcomes were compared between mutation carriers and non-carriers. Univariate and multivariate analyses Cox proportional-hazards models were used to compute independent predictors of survival outcomes. No statistically significant differences were identified in relation to tumor size, T stage, stage, Ki-67 status and tumor differentiation grade between the two groups. The median follow-up period was 36 months for mutation carriers and 41 months for non-carriers. A higher proportion of BRCA1 mutation non-carriers experienced distant recurrence compared with that of mutation carriers (P<0.03). BRCA1 mutation carriers had a significantly higher BCS than non-carriers (94.9 vs. 76.9%; P<0.02). In the univariate analyses, BRCA1-positive status was associated with decreased risk of distant recurrence (HR, 0.228; 95% Cl, 0.052-0.997; P<0.049) and breast cancer-specific mortality (HR, 0.209; 95% Cl, 0.048-0.902; P<0.036). In the multivariate analysis Cox proportional-hazards model, BRCA1-positive status was an independent favorable prognostic factor for distant recurrence-free survival (HR, 3.301; 95% Cl, 1.102-9.893; P<0.033). In conclusion, results of the present study demonstrate that positive BRCA1 founder mutation status in TNBC, with no evidence of ovarian or other cancer type in advanced stage, significantly improves prognosis.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of miRNA-32 (miR-32) on the biological behavior of the human gastric cancer cell line, SGC-7901. SGC-7901 cells were transfected with miR-32-mimic, miR-32-inhibitor and empty plasmid vectors using Lipofectamine™ 2000. The expression of GFP was observed by fluorescent microscopy and miR-32 gene expression was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The cell counting kit-8 assay was performed to evaluate the effect of miR-32 expression on cell proliferation in vitro. Alterations in the migration and metastatic potential of SGC-7901 cells, prior to and following miR-32 gene transfection, were assayed by cell chemotactic migration and invasion tests. The results of the current study showed that the proliferation rate of the transfected SGC-7901 cells overexpressing miR-32 is reduced and cell chemotactic migration and invasion potentials is markedly reduced following miR-32-mimic transfection (P<0.05). In addition, the results demonstrated that overexpression of miR-32 greatly inhibits the proliferation and decreases the migration and invasion capabilities of SGC-7901 cells in vitro.",

Between 2003 and 2012, 1,024 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus were treated at the Department of Thoracic Cancer, West China Hospital (Chengdu, China). Of these patients, 37 were >70 years old and had not undergone surgery, and were selected for analysis. Of these 37 patients, CRT had been administered to 20 (54%). Actuarial survival rates were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method. The one-year survival rate in the CRT group (n=20) was 85%, while 35% of patients in the RT group (n=17) survived for more than one year. The overall and progression-free survival in the CRT group versus the RT group were 17 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 11.861-22.139] versus eight months (95% CI, 6.674-9.326) (P=0.013) and 14 months (95% CI, 9.617-18.383) versus five months (95% CI, 2.311-7.689) (P=0.01), respectively. Patients irradiated with a dose of >50 Gy exhibited an improved survival rate compared with patients who received a dose of ≤50 Gy (18 vs. 14 months; P=0.049). Furthermore, patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of ≤1 had an improved prognosis compared with those with an ECOG score of 2 (14 vs. seven months; P=0.006). The two regimens were well-tolerated and there were no therapy-associated mortalities. The current retrospective study indicated that patients of >70 years old with inoperable esophageal SCC and a good ECOG score exhibit comparably better safety levels with CRT and improved survival rates compared with RT alone.",

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are enriched with cells that undergo EMT. The activity of telomerase is maintained in normal stem cells and a number of malignant tumors. The current study observed the heterogeneity of telomerase activity among individual osteosarcoma cells. We hypothesized that telomerase-positive (TELpos) cells are enriched for stem cell-like and EMT properties. A human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter-reporter was applied to assess the telomerase activity of individual MG63 osteosarcoma cells and sort them into TELpos and telomerase-negative (TELneg) subpopulations. It was found that the TELpos cells exhibited an enhanced ability to form sarcospheres in vitro. In addition, TELpos cells exhibited a higher expression of vimentin, accompanied by an increased long/short axis ratio. A panel of EMT-related genes was evaluated by quantitative PCR and western blot analysis, and were found to be significantly upregulated in TELpos cells. Next, the in vitro migration capacity was examined by Transwell assay, which confirmed that TELpos cells are more prone to migration (2.6 fold). The results of the present study support the concept that EMT also applies to mesenchymal-derived osteosarcoma and draws a connection between telomerase and EMT characteristics.",

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. It is necessary to improve the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in lung cancer in order to develop more effective therapeutics for the treatment of this fatal disease. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway has been known to be important in a number of cancer types, including lung cancer. Pygopus (Pygo) is a recently identified downstream component of the Wnt signaling pathway required for β-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF)-dependent transcription. However, the role of Pygo in lung cancer remains to be elucidated. The present study showed that Pygo2 is overexpressed in human lung cancer tissue samples and cell lines. Expression levels of Pygo2 were found to correlate with cytosolic β-catenin protein levels in the samples examined. Co-immunofluorescent staining showed that Pygo2 protein accumulated in the nuclei and colocalized with nuclear β-catenin in lung cancer cell lines expressing Pygo2. To investigate the functional importance of the Pygo2 overexpression in lung cancer, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to knockdown Pygo2 mRNA in lung cancer cells expressing the gene. Pygo2 shRNA was observed to inhibit cell proliferation and decrease β-catenin/TCF-dependent transcriptional activity in vitro. Furthermore, Pygo2 shRNA significantly suppressed lung cancer xenograft models in vivo (P<0.05). These results suggested that Pygo2 is a putative therapeutic target for human lung cancer and overexpression of Pygo2 may be important for aberrant Wnt activation in lung cancer.",

        "abstract": "Pemetrexed (PEM), a multi-targeted antifolate, has promising clinical activity in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. However, the majority of patients eventually acquire resistance to PEM. To evaluate the resistant mechanisms, the A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line was exposed to stepwise increasing PEM concentrations of 1.6, 6.4 and 16 μM to establish three PEM-resistant lung cancer cell lines, A549/PEM-1.6, -6.4 and -16. Growth inhibition was determined by the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Expression of the genes encoding thymidylate synthase (TS), reduced folate carrier (RFC) and folypoly-γ-glutamate synthetase (FPGS) were analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The three A549 cell lines showed more resistance to PEM (3.7-, 17.3(-) and 38.0-fold, respectively) compared with that of the parental cell line, which also showed cross-resistance to cisplatin, but not to docetaxel, vinorelbine and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). TS gene expression was significantly increased in three PEM-resistant cells, relative to that of the parental cells, in a PEM dose-dependent manner. Knockdown of TS expression with siRNA enhanced the cytotoxicity of PEM in A549/PEM-16 cells. By contrast, the levels of RFC and FPGS gene expression in A549/PEM-1.6 and -6.4 cells were significantly decreased, whereas the levels of the two genes were restored in A549/PEM-16 cells. In summary, PEM-resistant A549 cells remained sensitive to docetaxel, vinorelbine and 5-FU. TS expression appeared to be associated with resistance to PEM, which may be a predictive marker for PEM sensitivity in lung adenocarcinoma.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to determine the impact of obesity on radiation-induced gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity. The cases of 54 patients with prostate cancer, treated with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (RT), were reviewed. For each patient, the body mass index (BMI), distance between the prostate and rectum (D) on a computerised tomography scan and the dosimetric parameters of the rectum and bladder in the planning data of RT, were analyzed. GI and GU toxicity was assessed during and following RT. The results of the patients with a BMI of <25 (lower BMI) were compared with those of the patients with a BMI of ≥25 (higher BMI). The higher BMI group exhibited significantly lower doses of V60 and V65 in the rectum than the lower BMI group. No significant differences were found in D and bladder doses between the two groups. The incidence of acute GI and GU toxicity and late GI and GU toxicity were 41.7, 19.4, 35.3 and 5.7% in the lower BMI group, respectively, and 27.8, 27.8, 5.9 and 35.3% in the higher BMI group, respectively. In addition, a significant difference was found in the incidence of late GU toxicity between the two groups. Among patients who underwent RT for prostate cancer, those with higher BMIs had a tendency to show lower incidences of GI toxicity and higher incidences of GU toxicity than patients with lower BMIs. To conclude, an increased effort must be made to reduce rectal doses in patients with lower BMIs. Conversely, increased care for GU toxicity must be provided for overweight patients.",

The present study investigated the effects of VPA on the radiosensitization of the rat C6 glioma cell line in vitro. To select an appropriate treatment concentration and time, MTT and flow cytometry assays were performed to measure the inhibitory effects of VPA at various concentrations and incubation time-points. The radiosensitizing effect of VPA was determined using clonogenic experiments. VPA- and radiation-induced C6 apoptosis was analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. Cell proliferation was significantly inhibited by VPA in a time- and dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). VPA enhanced radiation-induced C6 cell death and there was clear inhibition of clonogenic formation [sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER), 1.30]. This effect was closely associated with the concentration of VPA. VPA treatment decreased the mRNA and protein levels of Bcl-2, whereas increased changes were detected with Bax. At a concentration of 0.5 mmol/l, VPA had a low toxicity and enhanced the radiosensitization of the C6 cells. VPA may radiosensitize glioma cells by inhibiting cellular proliferation and inducing apoptosis by regulating apoptosis-related molecular changes.",

The present study aimed to investigate the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of paxillin in gastric cancer. The expression of paxillin was evaluated using tissue microarrays of gastric adjacent non-cancerous mucosa, adenoma and carcinoma specimens by immunohistochemistry. Paxillin expression was compared against clinicopathological parameters and the survival time of the patients. Paxillin was highly expressed in gastric adenoma compared with that in non-neoplastic mucosa and carcinoma (P<0.05). Paxillin expression was lower in the younger carcinoma patients compared with that in the elder carcinoma patients (P<0.05). Paxillin expression was negatively correlated with tumor size, depth of invasion and lymph node metastasis, but not with patient gender, lymphatic or venous invasion, or TNM staging (P>0.05). Higher paxillin expression was observed in intestinal-type compared with diffuse-type carcinoma (P<0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated a positive association between paxillin expression and cumulative survival rate in all, advanced and intestinal-type carcinoma patients (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model indicated that patient age, depth of invasion, lymphatic invasion, lymph node metastasis, TNM staging and Lauren classification were independent prognostic factors for all gastric carcinomas (P<0.05). Aberrant paxillin expression may be involved in the growth, invasion, metastasis and differentiation of gastric carcinoma. Altered paxillin expression may, therefore, be employed as an indicator of pathobiological behaviors and prognosis of gastric carcinomas.",

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are a cluster of short non-protein coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression, which is involved in fundamental cellular processes, including the response of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents. The present study investigated the role of miR-106a in the development of drug resistance in ovarian cancer cells. The expression of miR-106a in the ovarian cancer OVCAR3 cell line and the cisplatin (CDDP)-resistant ovarian cancer OVCAR3/CIS cell line was detected using stem-loop quantitative (q)PCR. The OVCAR3 and OVCAR3/CIS cells were transfected with mimics or inhibitors of miR-106a or with negative control (NC) RNA using lipofectamine 2000. Luciferase reporter assays were used to determine whether PDCD4 was a direct target of miR-106a in the OVCAR3 cells. The expression levels of the PDCD4 proteins were assessed using qRT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Drug sensitivity was analyzed using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, while apoptosis was determined by fluorescence-activating cell sorting analysis. The expression levels of miR-106a were upregulated in the CDDP-resistant ovarian cancer OVCAR3/CIS cell line compared with the parental OVCAR3 cell line. However, the PDCD4 protein levels were decreased in the OVCAR3/CIS cells compared with the OVCAR3 cells. The luciferase reporter assays revealed that PDCD4 was a direct miR-106a target in the OVCAR3 cells. Transfection of the OVCAR3/CIS cells with inhibitors of miR-106a enhanced the sensitivity of the OVCAR3/CIS cells to CDDP and increased CDDP-induced apoptosis. The expression of the PDCD4 protein and the sensitivity to CDDP was decreased in the OVCAR3 cells that were transfected with the mimics of miR-106a. The knockdown of PDCD4 expression using PDCD4-specific siRNAs in the OVCAR3 cells demonstrated that PDCD4 is a key signaling molecule in OVCAR3 cell CDDP-induced resistance. miR-106a may be involved in the development of drug resistance and the regulation of PDCD4 expression, at least in part, by modulating CDDP-induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells.",

An initial partial response to icotinib was achieved, and graft function remained good. However, the patient subsequently developed interstitial pneumonitis. The plasma concentrations of rapamycin and icotinib were within the normal ranges, which excluded the possibility of a pharmacokinetic drug interaction and indicated that the interstitial pneumonitis was likely to be associated with the side-effects of icotinib. Drug therapy was discontinued and the patient underwent a segmentectomy. Tacrolimus was administered for ongoing renal graft immunosuppression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the concomitant administration of icotinib and rapamycin in post-transplant de novo lung cancer.

In the literature, the definition of EGC is clear, however, there is heterogeneity in the definition of AGC. In the current study, all parameters of the TNM classification for AGC reported in each previous study were individually analysed. It was necessary to perform a comprehensive systematic literature search of all previous studies that have reported a definition of ACG to guarantee homogeneity in the assessment of surgical outcome. It must be understood that the term 'advanced gastric cancer' may implicate a number of stages of disease, and studies must highlight the exact clinical TNM stages used for evaluation of the study.",

Proteins were extracted from five gastric epithelial cell lines and from 10 specimens of matched GC and adjacent normal tissues. The expression of γH2AX, a biomarker for the detection of DNA DSBs, in gastric tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. The expression of γH2AX progressively increased in tissues according to pathological stage from CG to Dys, but was slightly decreased in GC. H. pylori infection was associated with increased γH2AX expression, IM and Dys. Overexpression of γH2AX in GC was found to correlate with tumor location, gross appearance, differentiation, depth of invasion, TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. The results indicated that DSBs appear to be an early molecular event in gastric carcinogenesis, which may be associated with H. pylori infection. Moreover, immunohistochemical staining of γH2AX was found to correlate with a number of clinicopathological characteristics. The expression of γH2AX may serve as a valuable biomarker for the diagnosis and progression of GC.",

There was no statistically significant difference in PSA response rate between groups A and B (65 vs. 47.4%, P=0.341). The tumor response rate in group A was significantly greater compared with that in group B (55 vs. 21.1%, P=0.048). The median PFS was longer in group A compared with that in group B (10 vs. 8 months, P=0.043). There was no statistically significant difference in median OS between the two groups (19 vs. 17 months, P=0.348), but one patient displayed a complete tumor response in group A. In groups A and B, transient grade 3 to 4 neutropenia was observed in nine and six patients, grade 3 to 4 anemia was observed in three and five patients, and grade 3 to 4 general fatigue was observed in four and one patient(s), respectively. The proportion of patients with grade 3 to 4 toxicity was not statistically different between the two groups.

Detection of Ki-67 is a useful tool in breast cancer and contributes to its molecular classification. The current study proposes a method for the quantification of Ki-67-positive tumor nuclei, which allows for the determination of the exact IK value that is required for tumor stratification based on the proliferation rate. The IK was assessed in 81 successive cases of diagnosed invasive ductal breast carcinoma using a semi-automated method that accurately identifies positive tumor cell nuclei. This method prevents the inclusion of other possible positive cells, including lymphoid, normal epithelia and hyperplastic. In small specimens with increased cell density, where the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio is markedly in favor of the nucleus and the distance between nuclei is small, the method allows precise quantification of the nuclei, even when the limits between nuclei are difficult to identify. In addition, images may be stored in a database, including the assessments, and easily accessed when required. We hypothesize that the semi-automated method for counting nuclei offers the most accurate method of assessing the IK and avoids counting errors that may occur through other methods.",

        "abstract": "Astrocyte-elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) has been reported to be associated with cancer progression in various types of human cancers, including liver cancer. However, to date, the molecular mechanism of AEG-1 action on the growth of liver cancer cells has been poorly elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of AEG-1 on the proliferation and apoptosis of liver cancer cells and the role of IL-6 in this process using the HepG2 human hepatoma cell line. shRNAs targeting AEG-1 were used to silence the expression of AEG-1. The effects on cell growth were detected by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, colony formation and cell cycle assays. Apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of IL-6 was examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the phosphorylation of Stat3 was detected by western blotting. AEG-1 knockdown was observed to induce cell proliferation inhibition and apoptosis through the suppression of IL-6 secretion. Stat3, a downstream target of IL-6 signaling, was suppressed in the AEG-1-silenced cells and target genes, including Bcl-2 and crystalin, αB, which are associated with cell survival, were downregulated. Overall, the findings suggest that aberrant AEG-1 expression promotes the growth of HepG2 liver cancer cells, contributing to the progression of liver cancer, which may partly be mediated by IL-6 signaling.",

        "abstract": "The cancer stem cell (CSC) theory implies that CSCs are surrounded by supportive stromal cells, which are known as the CSC niche. Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) shows a multitude of functional effects in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells, including migration and polarization. Therefore, the SDF-1-CXCR4 axis may be involved in the pathophysiology of the progression, recurrence and metastasis of malignant diseases of the head and neck. In the present study, the CD44(+) HNSCC UM-SCC-11A cell line was used as a model for CSCs. The interaction between the UM-SCC-11A cells and the supportive microenvironmental cells, including fibrocytes, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human microvascular vein endothelial cells (HMVECs) was evaluated. All the cell types that were tested were shown to secrete different concentrations of SDF-1 into the surrounding culture medium [mean (m)fibro, 1243.3±156.2 pg/ml; mHMVEC, 1061.4±23.2 pg/ml; mHUVEC, 849.6±110.9 pg/ml]. The migration of the UM-SCC-11A cells towards the supportive cells was increased by a higher supply of SDF-1 (contrfibro, 315.23±61.55 μm; mfibro, 477.73±143.7 μm; Pfibro=0.003; contrHMVEC, 123.41±66.68 μm; mHMVEC, 249.04±111.95 μm; PHMVEC=0.004; contrHUVEC, 189.7±93.26 μm; mHUVEC, 260.82±161.58 μm). The amount of the UM-SCC-11A cells that migrated towards the differentiated fibrocytes was significantly higher than that which migrated towards the HMVECs or HUVECs (Pfibro/HMVEC=2.12E-11; Pfibro/HUVEC=2.28E-5). Cell-cell interaction by podia formation of the UM-SCC-11A cells was observed in all the supportive cell types that were tested. Broadly based cell-cell contacts were observed. By contrast, digitiform podia formations presented by the UM-SCC-11A cells were determined using fluorescence microscopy. The SDF-1-CXCR4 axis is postulated to be a crucial pathway in the interaction between CSCs and their surrounding supportive cells. Understanding the cell-cell interactions in the CSC niche using in vitro models may aid in gaining further insight into these mechanisms and finding new strategies of therapy in this field.",

A surgical specimen of pancreatic cancer was immunostained with antibodies specific to Fz2. Cell proliferation assays were performed with MIA-Paca2 cells transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) of Fz2. Fz2 was found to be expressed in all pancreatic cancer cell lines, with the exception of NOR-P1. Immunostaining revealed that Fz2 was not expressed in normal pancreatic tissues, while it was expressed in pancreatic cancer cells. The expression levels of cyclin D1 were analyzed by quantitative PCR. The proliferation and expression of cyclin D1 were suppressed with the siRNA and shRNA of Fz2 in the MIA-Paca2 cells. Therefore, Fz2 is a potential target for the molecular therapy of pancreatic cancer.",

Previous studies have described the hypermethylation of the CpG island in the promoter region as a key mechanism involved in silencing tumor suppressor genes. The epigenetic alterations regulating CHFR expression and the clinical significance of CHFR downregulation remain unclear. A total of 40 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent primary resection were enrolled in this study. CHFR mRNA expression was quantified, followed by an evaluation of the methylation status using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) techniques in 29 patients. The correlation between CHFR expression and MSP status was then analyzed. In addition, the significance of CHFR expression was determined, with respect to clinicopathological features and overall survival. Aberrant hypermethylation of the CHFR gene was observed in 13 of 29 primary esophageal cancers. The CHFR expression levels of the methylated status samples was significantly lower than that of the unmethylated status samples (P=0.014). CHFR expression levels did not exhibit clinical significance with respect to the patient characteristics or overall survival. Hypermethylation of the CHFR gene is a common event in the development of primary esophageal cancer. CpG island hypermethylation of the promoter region in the CHFR gene is a key mechanism involved in silencing the CHFR gene in patients with esophageal cancer.",

We calculated the five-year relapse-free survival rate (5Y-RFS) and five-year overall survival rate (5Y-OS) of the ONC(+) and ONC(-) groups. The 5Y-RFS was 71.4% in the ONC(-) group and 47.5% in the ONC(+) group (P=0.003). The 5Y-OS was 68.8 and 48.4%, respectively (P=0.008). ONCs were found in 34.8% of stage II patients and were also detected in 66.7% of stage III patients. For distinguishing between the recurrence and non-recurrence groups, the sensitivity of ONC(+) was 64.5% (40/62; P=0.003), the positive predictive value (PPV) was 49.4% (40/81), the specificity was 59.8% (61/102) and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 73.5% (61/83). This high sensitivity indicates that ONC positivity may be a significant indicator for high-risk patients in the early postoperative period, and a lack of ONCs may be a useful indicator for identifying low-risk patients, as patients without ONCs had a high NPV.",

Although studies investigating the function of NANOG in cancer have shown that it plays several roles, such as in cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis, the overall function of NANOG in cancer cells has remained elusive. In the present study, NANOG expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) was examined to determine its potential clinical significance. The expression of NANOG protein was assessed in 60 patients with OSCC by immunohistochemistry, and its correlation with clinicopathological factors and metastasis was evaluated. NANOG protein levels in human OSCC cell lines were determined by western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. NANOG protein expression was identified in 52 cases (86.7%) and expression levels were higher in primary foci of poorly differentiated OSCC than in those of well-differentiated OSCC, indicating that NANOG expression is associated with OSCC differentiation. Regardless of the differentiation levels of primary foci, NANOG expression levels in metastatic foci were extremely high. In addition, NANOG expression in metastatic foci was maintained at high levels following preoperative adjuvant therapy. Furthermore, NANOG protein was detected at an identical level in human OSCC cell lines. These data indicate that NANOG-expressing OSCC cells tend to metastasize and that metastatic tumors expressing NANOG may be resistant to preoperative adjuvant therapy, including chemoradiation. Thus, assessment of NANOG expression may assist the strategy for treatment of OSCC metastasis.",

        "abstract": "Curcumin, a non-nutritive yellow pigment derived from the rhizome of Curcuma longa (turmeric), is considered to be an established nutraceutical with anticancer activity. Turmeric contains three principal components, curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin, of which curcumin is most abundant and potent. The concurrence of a high consumption of turmeric and a low incidence of prostate cancer in Asian countries may suggest a role for curcumin in chemoprevention. Curcumin has been identified to exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anticarcinogenic properties. Since the compound does not exhibit side effects, curcumin has been designated for several clinical trials as a treatment for human cancers. The pro-apototic, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory characteristics of curcumin are implicated in its anticancer activity, yet the mechanism of action of curcumin remains unknown. To achieve an effective pharmacological outcome, curcumin must reach and sustain appropriate levels at the site of action. However, the main disadvantage of curcumin is its high metabolic instability and poor aqueous solubility that limits its systemic bioavailability. To overcome this difficulty, the present study tested the anticancer activity of new curcumin-like compounds (E21cH and Q012095H). Also, the use of new medicaments requires an understanding of their pharmacokinetic profiles and targets. Thus, molecular modeling methods were used to identify the targets of curcumin and curcumin-like compounds compared with other anticancer drugs (Q012138 and Q012169AT), which were used as the controls. The present study identified several enzymes that are targeted by curcumin, aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10), serine/threonine-protein kinase, protein kinase C, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), cyclooxygenase and epidermal growth factor receptor, which were tested as targets for these anticancer chemicals. All the examined small compounds demonstrated anticancer activity in the in vitro experiments and may impact cancer cells by acting on AKR1B10, MMP-9 and their targets.",

The treatment of LRRC remains a clinical challenge. LRRC has been regarded as an incurable disease state leading to a poor quality of life and a limited survival time. However, curative reoperations have proved beneficial for treating LRRC. A complete resection of recurrent tumors (R0 resection) allows the treatment to be curative rather than palliative, which is a milestone in medicine. In LRRC cases, the difficulty of achieving an R0 resection is associated with the post-operative prognosis and is affected by several clinical factors, including the staging of the local recurrence (LR), accompanying symptoms, patterns of tumors and combined therapy. The risk factors following primary surgery that lead to an increased rate of LR are summarized in this study, including the surgical, pathological and therapeutic factors.",

Replication-incompetent HIV-1-based lentiviral vectors have emerged as powerful and safe tools for gene delivery. Commonly, HNSCC is a locoregional disease that presents at or close to the body surface. Thus, HNSCC is amendable to intratumoral injections of gene therapy vectors aimed at correcting defects associated with tumor suppressor genes to induce the direct cytotoxicity of cancer cells or immune modulation to promote antitumor immunity. Current investigations analyzing HNSCC gene mutations and stem cell markers and the cancer immunoediting concept are creating exciting therapeutic opportunities for lentiviral and other gene transfer vectors.

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to construct the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1/15-PGDH. The vector was used to transfect mouse murine forestomach carcinoma (MFC) cancer cells and observe the effects of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) on the proliferation of MFC. pcDNA3.1/15-PGDH was constructed using gene recombination technology and the vector was used to transfect MFC cells to build a stable transfected cell strain. The expression levels of 15-PGDH in the transfected cells were detected using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Optical Density (OD) values were determined using an MTT assay and used to draw cell growth curves. The effects of 15-PGDH on the proliferation of MFC were observed using a clone formation experiment. Following successful transfection by 15-PGDH, the relative expression levels of 15-PGDH in the MFC/15-PGDH cells were significantly higher (1.06±0.08) (P<0.01) compared with the empty plasmid-transfected group (0.22±0.01) and the untransfected group (0.21±0.01). Following transfection by 15-PGDH, cell growth was markedly inhibited. The MTT results showed that on days 4, 6 and 8, the 15-PGDH-transfected group had a low OD on average, which was significantly different (P<0.05) from the empty plasmid-transfected group or the untransfected group. The 15-PGDH-transfected group had a plating efficiency of 18%, and compared with the untransfected group (63%) and the empty plasmid-transfected group (59%), clone formation was significantly inhibited (P<0.01). Results of the present study indicate that transfection by 15-PGDH may significantly inhibit the proliferation and clone formation of MFC cells.",

        "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a recognized factor in nephrotoxicity induced by chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic (As). Grape seed extract (GSE) possesses antioxidant properties. The present study was designed to evaluate the beneficial effects of GSE against arsenic-induced renal injury. Healthy, male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to As in drinking water (30 ppm) with or without GSE (100 mg/kg) for 12 months. The serum proinflammatory cytokine levels and mRNA expression levels of fibrogenic markers in the renal tissues were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, respectively. The protein expression levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) subunits, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and phosphorylated Smad2/3 (pSmad2/3) were assessed using western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that cotreatment with GSE significantly improved renal function, as demonstrated by the reductions in relative kidney weight (% of body weight) and blood urea nitrogen, and the increase in the creatinine clearance capacity. GSE attenuated the As-induced changes in the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1β and the mRNA levels of TGF-β1, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and fibronectin (FN) in renal tissue. Furthermore, administration of GSE markedly reduced As-stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and Nox activity, as well as the protein expression levels of the NADPH subunits (Nox2, p47phox and Nox4). In addition, GSE cotreatment was correlated with a significant reduction in TGF-β/Smad signaling, as demonstrated by the decreased protein levels of TGF-β1 and pSmad2/3 in renal tissue. This study indicated that GSE may be a useful agent for the prevention of nephrotoxicity induced by chronic exposure to As. GSE may exert its effects through the suppression of Nox and inhibition of TGF-β/Smad signaling activation.",

        "abstract": "Marigold (Tagetes erecta L.) has long been used as a medicinal herb for a number of therapeutic activities. In the present study, the cytotoxicities of ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts of marigold flowers and their inhibitory effects on elastase and tyrosinase enzymes were investigated. An MTT assay was performed to measure the cytotoxicity of these two extracts on the H460 lung cancer and the Caco-2 colon cancer cell lines. An elastase assay kit, based on the digestion of a non-fluorescent elastin substrate to highly fluorescent fragments by elastase, was used for the elastase inhibition assay. Tyrosinase inhibition activity was investigated using the dopachrome method with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) as a substrate. The data obtained in this study demonstrated that the extracts were nontoxic to H460 and Caco-2 cell lines. The elastase inhibition activities of ethanol (250 μg/ml) and ethyl acetate (125 μg/ml) extracts were found to be significantly higher than that of the negative control. The tyrosinase inhibition activities of ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts, in terms of the mean inhibition concentration (IC50), were 1,078 and 1,467 μg/ml, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the present study has demonstrated for the first time that marigold flower extracts possess tyrosinase inhibition activity. The activities of ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts of marigold flowers were investigated in vitro and indicated that these extracts possess useful properties that may be of interest for cosmetic development.",

In the present study, the expression of NAG-1 was assessed in human gastric carcinoma, tumor-adjacent normal tissues and normal gastric mucosa, with the aim to investigate the role of NAG-1 in the carcinogenesis and development of gastric carcinoma. NAG-1 protein expression was evaluated using immunohistochemical staining, while the expression of NAG-1 mRNA was evaluated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. It was observed that adenocarcinoma tissues had a lower expression of NAG-1 than normal gastric tissues. Furthermore, moderately and well-differentiated adenocarcinoma tissues expressed more NAG-1 protein than the poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma tissues. The expression of NAG-1 protein in adenocarcinoma tissues did not correlate with tumor-node-metastasis staging, infiltration degree or tumor size. The NAG-1 mRNA expression in adenocarcinoma tissues was also lower than that in normal gastric tissues. In conclusion, NAG-1 was poorly expressed in adenocarcinoma tissues and inversely correlated with the degree of tumor differentiation. These results indicate that NAG-1 may have an anti-oncogenic function in the carcinogenesis and development of gastric carcinoma, and that its attenuated or absent expression may lead to gastric carcinogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Oxidative stress is significant in numerous types of cancer. Tobacco smoke, an important risk factor for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), is able to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cause oxidative DNA damage. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an endogenous antioxidant enzyme that is critical in limiting the oxidative burden effectively. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the mitochondrial SOD2 and Cu/Zn enzyme SOD1 gene polymorphisms on the susceptibility to and clinicopathological characteristics of OSCC, as well as the synergistic effect between these gene polymorphisms and the well-known risk factor of tobacco consumption. Patients with clinically diagnosed OSCC (n=362) and healthy normal individuals (n=358) were investigated for four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs4880, rs5746136, rs1804450 and rs11556620) by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA sequencing methods. Following adjustment for other confounders, no significant difference was observed in the rs5746136 SOD2 SNPs between the patients and controls. However, the incidence of the CT genotype of SOD2 SNP rs4880 was higher in the patients than in normal subjects in the additive model [CT vs. TT; P=0.045; adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=1.484; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.009-2.182] and in the dominant model (CT/CC vs. TT; P=0.022; AOR=1.559; 95% CI, 1.067-2.278). For those who smoked, the incidence of the CT genotype of rs4880 increased markedly in the patients compared with the controls in the additive model (CT vs. TT; P=0.003; AOR=2.325; 95% CI, 1.330-4.064) and in the dominant model (CT/CC vs. TT; P=0.001; AOR=2.448; 95% CI, 1.417-4.230). For SOD1, polymorphisms at rs1804450 and rs11556620 were not present in any of the OSCC or control subjects. The results suggest that SOD2 rs4880 may be involved in the tumorigenesis of OSCC and may be useful as a genetic susceptibility marker for OSCC.",

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of CDK4 expression by δEF1 have not yet been elucidated. The present study demonstrated that the ectopic expression of δEF1 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells significantly increased the activity of the CDK4 promoter. Deletion of the E2-box (CACGTG), which is located at position -197/-191 on the human CDK4 promoter, significantly attenuated the activation of CDK4 transcription by δEF1. In addition, a CDK4 promoter-M construct was generated via site-directed mutagenesis of the E2-box on the human CDK4 promoter. Luciferase assay showed that the activation of CDK4 promoter-M activity by δEF1 was markedly decreased compared with the CDK4-promoter-0.4k promoter. Knockdown of δEF1 using RNA interference resulted in the inhibition of CDK4 promoter activity. These observations suggest that δEF1 upregulates CDK4 transcription via the E2-box element on the CDK4 promoter.",

        "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most lethal type of cancer in the urinary system and often presents as a metastatic disease. Furthermore, there are no effective treatments for the disease. Several studies based on gene expression profiling have been performed with the aim of gaining insights into the pathogenesis of RCC; however, few studies have investigated RCC at the pathway level to search for the possible pathways involved in clear cell RCC (CCRCC). In this study, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted on microarray datasets from CCRCC tissue. DAVID functional enrichment analysis was performed based on the dysregulated genes that were identified in a meta-analysis performed on the microarray datasets from CCRCC tissue. In GSEA, 17 down- and 12 upregulated pathways coexisted in six datasets. The majority of the upregulated pathways were associated with the immune system. In addition, 32 dysregulated pathways were obtained from DAVID functional enrichment analysis, based on the abnormal genes identified by meta-analysis. This study demonstrated that cross-GSEA is a useful method for exploring the critical pathways involved CCRCC; however, an individual dataset with a small sample may introduce bias. A cross-GSEA based on certain well-designed datasets may be required to further the progress made in this study, following the analysis of its results.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of FB1 on the proliferation, cell-cycle and apoptosis of normal human esophageal epithelial cells (HEECs) and to explore the molecular mechanisms of these effects. The proliferation of HEECs treated with FB1 was assessed using a colorimetric assay, while analyses of the cell cycle and apoptosis were performed using flow cytometry and the measurement of the protein expressions of genes associated with the cell cycle was conducted using western blotting. The results showed that FB1 stimulated the proliferation of HEECs, decreased the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase and reduced apoptosis. The western blotting results showed that FB1 significantly increased the protein expression of cyclin D1 and significantly decreased the protein expression of cyclin E, p21 and p27. The results indicated that FB1 stimulated the proliferation of HEECs by affecting the cell cycle and apoptosis. This mechanism was associated with changes in cyclin D1, cyclin E, p21 and p27 expression.",

        "abstract": "Over the past decade, several kinase inhibitors have been approved based on their clinical benefit in cancer patients. Unfortunately, in many cases, patients develop resistance to these agents via secondary mutations and alternative mechanisms. To date, several major mechanisms of acquired resistance, such as secondary mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene, amplification of the MET gene and overexpression of hepatocyte growth factor, have been reported. This review describes the recent findings on the mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and acquired resistance to anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors, primarily focusing on non-small cell lung carcinoma.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of new therapeutic agents for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) implies that histologic subtyping and molecular predictive testing are now essential for therapeutic decisions. Histologic subtype predicts the efficacy and toxicity of some treatment agents, as do genetic alterations, which can be important predictive factors in treatment selection. Molecular markers, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement, are the best predictors of response to specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment agents. As the majority of patients with NSCLC present with unresectable disease, it is therefore crucial to optimize the use of tissue samples for diagnostic and predictive examinations, particularly for small biopsy and cytology specimens. Therefore, each institution needs to develop a diagnostic approach requiring close communication between the pulmonologist, radiologist, pathologist, and oncologist in order to preserve sufficient biopsy materials for molecular analysis as well as to ensure rapid diagnosis. Currently, personalized medicine in NSCLC is based on the histologic subtype and molecular status. This review summarizes strategies for tissue acquisition, histologic subtyping and molecular analysis for predictive testing in NSCLC.",

        "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating and pervasive mental illness with devastating effects on many aspects of psychological, cognitive and social wellbeing. Epidemiological and life-cycle data point to significant differences in the incidence and course of schizophrenia between men and women, suggesting that estrogen plays a \"protective\" role . Adjunctive estrogen therapy has been shown to be effective in enhancing the treatment of schizophrenia in women. In men, consideration of estrogen therapy has been impacted by concerns of feminisation, however, clinical trials using estrogen to treat prostate cancer, bone density loss and even aggression in men with dementia or traumatic brain injury, show estrogen to be a safe and effective therapy. Findings do, however, suggest that further exploration of a therapeutic role for adjunctive estradiol treatment in men with schizophrenia is warranted. The development of the new estrogen compounds - Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) which do not cause feminisation - opens up the possibility of using a different type of estrogen for a longer period of time at higher doses. Estrogen could therefore prove to be an important component in the treatment of psychotic symptoms in men with schizophrenia. This review explains the scientific rationale behind the estrogen hypothesis and how it can be clinically utilised to address concerns unique to the care of men with schizophrenia.",

About one decade ago, the conservation of miRNA in humans was also discovered. At present, the loss of certain miRNAs and the overexpression of miRNAs have been demonstrated in many types of diseases, especially cancer. A key miRNA in lung cancer was reported soon after the initial discovery of a tumor-suppressive miRNA in a hematological malignancy. Various causes of miRNA disruption are known, including deletions, mutations, and epigenetic suppression as well as coding genes. The recent accumulation of knowledge regarding epigenetic transcriptional suppression has revealed the suppression of several miRNAs in lung cancer in response to epigenetic changes, such as H3K9 methylation prior to DNA methylation and H3K27 methylation independent of DNA methylation. In this review, recent knowledge of miRNA disruption in lung cancer as a result of epigenetic changes is discussed. Additionally, emerging cancer-specific changes in RNA editing and their impact on miRNA function are described.",

MSCs may promote tumor progression through immune modulation, but other tumor suppressive effects of MSCs have also beendescribed. The discrepancy between these results may arise from issues related to different tissue sources, individual donor variability, and injection timing of MSCs. The expression of critical receptors such as Toll-like receptor is variable a teach time point of treatment, which may also determine the effects of MSCs on tumor progression. However, factors released from malignant cells, as well as surrounding tissues and the vasculature, are still regarded as a \"black box. \" Thus, it is still difficult to clarify the specific role of MSCs in cancer development. Whether MSCs support or suppress tumor progression is currently unclear, but it is clear that systemically administered MSCs can be recruited and migrate toward tumors. These findings are important because they can be used as a basis for initiating studies to explore the incorporation of engineered MSCs as novel anti-tumor carriers, for the development of tumor-targeted therapies.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play pivotal roles in numerous biological processes, and their dysregulation is a common feature of human cancer. Thanks to recent advances in the analysis of the cancer epigenome, we now know that epigenetic alterations, including aberrant DNA methylation and histone modifications, are major causes of miRNA dysregulation in cancer. Moreover, the list of miRNA genes silenced in association with CpG island hypermethylation is rapidly growing, and various oncogenic miRNAs are now known to be upregulated via DNA hypomethylation. Histone modifications also play important roles in the dysregulation of miRNAs, and histone deacetylation and gain of repressive histone marks are strongly associated with miRNA gene silencing. Conversely, miRNA dysregulation is causally related to epigenetic alterations in cancer. Thus aberrant methylation of miRNA genes is a potentially useful biomarker for detecting cancer and predicting its outcome. Given that many of the silenced miRNAs appear to act as tumor suppressors through the targeting of oncogenes, re-expression of the miRNAs could be an effective approach to cancer therapy, and unraveling the relationship between epigenetic alteration and miRNA dysregulation may lead to the discovery of new therapeutic targets.",

Although initiated by antigen engagement, it is the complex balance between co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory signals on DCs that results in T cell activation or tolerance. Even when already activated, tumor-specific T cells can be neutralized by the expression of co-inhibitory molecules on tumor cells. These and other immunosuppressive cues in the tumor microenvironment are major factors currently hampering the application of DC vaccination. In this review, we discuss recent data regarding the essential and complex role of co-inhibitory molecules in regulating the immune response within the tumor microenvironment. In particular, possible therapeutic intervention strategies aimed at reversing or neutralizing suppressive networks within the tumor microenvironment will be emphasized. Importantly, blocking co-inhibitory molecule signaling, often referred to as immune checkpoint blockade, does not necessarily lead to an effective activation of tumor-specific T cells. Therefore, combination of checkpoint blockade with other immune potentiating therapeutic strategies, such as DC vaccination, might serve as a synergistic combination, capable of reversing effector T cells immunosuppression while at the same time increasing the efficacy of T cell-mediated immunotherapies. This will ultimately result in long-term anti-tumor immunity.",

        "abstract": "Human natural killer T (NKT) cells are characterized by their expression of an invariant T cell antigen receptor α chain variable region encoded by a Vα24Jα18 rearrangement. These NKT cells recognize α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) in conjunction with the MHC class I-like CD1d molecule and bridge the innate and acquired immune systems to mediate efficient and augmented immune responses. A prime example of one such function is adjuvant activity: NKT cells augment anti-tumor responses because they can rapidly produce large amounts of IFN-γ, which acts on NK cells to eliminate MHC negative tumors and also on CD8 cytotoxic T cells to kill MHC positive tumors. Thus, upon administration of α-GalCer-pulsed DCs, both MHC negative and positive tumor cells can be effectively eliminated, resulting in complete tumor eradication without tumor recurrence. Clinical trials have been completed in a cohort of 17 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancers and 10 cases of head and neck tumors. Sixty percent of advanced lung cancer patients with high IFN-γ production had significantly prolonged median survival times of 29.3 months with only the primary treatment. In the case of head and neck tumors, 10 patients who completed the trial all had stable disease or partial responses 5 weeks after the combination therapy of α-GalCer-DCs and activated NKT cells. We now focus on two potential powerful treatment options for the future. One is to establish artificial adjuvant vector cells containing tumor mRNA and α-GalCer/CD1d. This stimulates host NKT cells followed by DC maturation and NK cell activation but also induces tumor-specific long-term memory CD8 killer T cell responses, suppressing tumor metastasis even 1 year after the initial single injection. The other approach is to establish induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that can generate unlimited numbers of NKT cells with adjuvant activity. Such iPS-derived NKT cells produce IFN-γ in vitro and in vivo upon stimulation with α-GalCer/DCs, and mediated adjuvant effects, suppressing tumor growth in vivo.",

We will discuss the relevance of extranodal T cell priming within the TME as a means to effectively promote anti-tumor immunity and the strategic use of dendritic cell (DC)-based therapies to reinforce this clinically preferred process in the cancer-bearing host.",

We developed an analytical method that enables the quantitation of all the organic acids in the CAC in a single stable isotope dilution GC/MS analysis with deuterium-labeled analogs used as internal standards. The unstable α-keto acids are rapidly reduced with sodium borodeuteride to the corresponding stable α-deutero-α-hydroxy acids and these, along with their unlabeled analogs and other CAC organic acid intermediates, are converted to their tert-butyldimethylsilyl derivatives. Selected ion monitoring is employed with electron ionization. We validated this method by treating an untransformed mouse mammary epithelial cell line with well-known mitochondrial toxins affecting the electron transport chain and ATP synthase, which resulted in profound perturbations of the concentration of CAC intermediates.",

        "abstract": "This short article summarizes some of the research carried out recently by my laboratory colleagues on the function of DNA polymerase zeta (polζ) in mammalian cells. Some personal background is also described, relevant to research associations with Yale University and its continuing influence. Polζ is involved in the bypass of many DNA lesions by translesion DNA synthesis and is responsible for the majority of DNA damage-induced point mutagenesis in mammalian cells (including human cells), as well as in yeast. We also found that the absence of this enzyme leads to gross chromosomal instability in mammalian cells and increased spontaneous tumorigenesis in mice. Recently, we discovered a further unexpectedly critical role for polζ: it plays an essential role in allowing continued rapid proliferation of cells and tissues. These observations and others indicate that polζ engages frequently during DNA replication to bypass and tolerate DNA lesions or unusual DNA structures that are barriers for the normal DNA replication machinery.",

        "abstract": "DNA damage, malfunctions in DNA repair, and genomic instability are processes that intersect at the crossroads of carcinogenesis. Underscoring the importance of DNA repair in breast and ovarian tumorigenesis is the familial inherited cancer predisposition gene BRCA2. The role of BRCA2 in DNA double-strand break repair was first revealed based on its interaction with RAD51, a central player in homologous recombination. The RAD51 protein forms a nucleoprotein filament on single-stranded DNA, invades a DNA duplex, and initiates a search for homology. Once a homologous DNA sequence is found, the DNA is used as a template for the high-fidelity repair of the DNA break. Many of the biochemical features that allow BRCA2 to choreograph the activities of RAD51 have been elucidated and include: targeting RAD51 to single-stranded DNA while inhibiting binding to dsDNA, reducing the ATPase activity of RAD51, and facilitating the displacement of the single-strand DNA binding protein, Replication Protein A. These reinforcing activities of BRCA2 culminate in the correct positioning of RAD51 onto a processed DNA double-strand break and initiate its faithful repair by homologous recombination. In this review, I will address current biochemical data concerning the BRCA2 protein and highlight unanswered questions regarding BRCA2 function in homologous recombination and cancer.",

Pol ß is a key enzyme in the base excision repair (BER) pathway that functions in gap filling DNA synthesis subsequent to the excision of damaged DNA bases. A major focus of our studies is on the cellular roles of Pol ß. We have shown that germline and tumor-associated variants of Pol ß catalyze aberrant BER that leads to genomic instability and cellular transformation. Our studies suggest that Pol ß is critical for the maintenance of genomic stability and that it is a tumor suppressor. We have also shown that Pol ß functions during Prophase I of meiosis. Pol ß localizes to the synaptonemal complex and is critical for removal of the Spo11 complex from the 5' ends of double-strand breaks. Studies with Pol ß mutant mice are currently being undertaken to more clearly understand the function of Pol ß during meiosis. In this review, we will highlight our contributions from our studies of Pol ß germline and cancer-associated variants.",

Hypoxia transforms cell physiology in multiple ways, with profound changes in cell metabolism, cell growth, susceptibility to apoptosis, induction of angiogenesis, and increased motility. Over the past 20 years, our lab has determined that hypoxia also induces genetic instability. We have conducted a large series of experiments revealing that this instability occurs through the alteration of DNA repair pathways, including nucleotide excision repair, DNA mismatch repair, and homology dependent repair. Our work suggests that hypoxia, as a key component of solid tumors, can drive cancer progression through its impact on genomic integrity. However, the acquired changes in DNA repair that are induced by hypoxia may also render hypoxic cancer cells vulnerable to tailored strategies designed to exploit these changes.",

However, TiO2 nanoformulations have been shown to be toxic for living cells. In this article, we report the development of a new delivery system, based on nontoxic TiO2 nanoparticles, further conjugated with a monoclonal antibody against a novel and easily accessible tumor marker, e.g., the Kv 11.1 potassium channel. We synthesized, by simple solvothermal method, dicarboxylic acid-terminated PEG TiO2 nanocrystals (PEG-TiO2 NPs). Anti-Kv 11.1 monoclonal antibodies (Kv 11.1-Mab) were further linked to the terminal carboxylic acid groups. Proper conjugation was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Kv 11.1-Mab-PEG-TiO2 NPs efficiently recognized the specific Kv 11.1 antigen, both in vitro and in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, which express the Kv 11.1 channel onto the plasma membrane. Both PEG TiO2 and Kv 11.1-Mab-PEG-TiO2 NPs were not cytotoxic, but only Kv 11.1-Mab-PEG-TiO2 NPs were efficiently internalized into PDAC cells. Data gathered from this study may have further applications for the chemical design of nanostructures to be applied for therapeutic purposes in pancreatic cancer.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes remains a burgeoning global problem, necessitating ongoing efforts on the part of pharmaceutical and device manufacturers, patients, and society to curb the frightening trends in morbidity and mortality attributable to the malady. Since 1835 when phlorizin was discovered, sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors have rested tantalizingly on the horizon, promising a more physiological approach to glucose control. These agents lower glucose by enhancing its excretion by blocking reabsorption in the renal tubules, thus eliminating glucose from the body along with the molecules' attendant effects on caloric balance, plasma osmolality, and lipids. Consequently, SGLT-2 inhibitors improve glucose control to an extent comparable to other hypoglycemic agents while simultaneously reducing body weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol - an admirable portfolio. One agent, canagliflozin, has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and two other agents have progressed through Phase III trials, including dapagliflozin and empagliflozin. Collectively, when used as monotherapy, these agents have demonstrated reductions in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), body weight, and blood pressure of -0.34% to -1.03%, -2.0 to -3.4 kg, and -1.7 to -6.4 mmHg/-0.3 to -2.6 mmHg (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure), respectively. SGLT-2 inhibitors have been well tolerated, with hypoglycemia (0.9% to 4.3%) occurring infrequently in clinical trials. Safety signals related to breast and bladder cancer have arisen with dapagliflozin, though these are unsubstantiated and likely ascribed to the presence of preexisting cancer. As these agents emerge, clinicians should embrace the addition to the formulary for treating type 2 diabetes, but must also weight the risk-benefit of this new class in deciding which patient types are most likely to benefit from their novel mechanism of action.",

The ECM may be modified during cancer to allow and promote proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. The family of lysyl oxidase (LOX) enzymes cross-links collagens and elastin and, therefore, is a central player in ECM deposition and maturation. Extensive research has revealed how the LOX proteins participate in every stage of cancer progression, and two family members, LOX and LOX-like 2, have been linked to metastasis, the final stage of cancer responsible for over 90% of cancer patient deaths. However, LOX biosynthesis results in by-product with antiproliferative properties in certain cancers, and LOX enzymes may have different effects depending on the molecular network in which they are active. Therefore, the design of therapies targeting the LOX family needs to be guided by the molecular makeup of the individual disease and will probably require other agents to act on both the LOX enzymes and their associated network.",

Oleandrin (a toxic cardiac glycoside of N. oleander L.) inhibits the activity of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B chain (NF-κB) in various cultured cell lines (U937, CaOV3, human epithelial cells and T cells) as well as it induces programmed cell death in PC3 cell line culture. The mechanism of action includes improved cellular export of fibroblast growth factor-2, induction of apoptosis through Fas gene expression in tumor cells, formation of superoxide radicals that cause tumor cell injury through mitochondrial disruption, inhibition of interleukin-8 that mediates tumorigenesis and induction of tumor cell autophagy. The present review focuses the applicability of oleandrin in cancer treatment and concerned future perspective in the area.",

        "title": "Glia and pain: Is chronic pain a gliopathy?",
        "abstract": "Activation of glial cells and neuro-glial interactions are emerging as key mechanisms underlying chronic pain. Accumulating evidence has implicated 3 types of glial cells in the development and maintenance of chronic pain: microglia and astrocytes of the central nervous system (CNS), and satellite glial cells of the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia. Painful syndromes are associated with different glial activation states: (1) glial reaction (ie, upregulation of glial markers such as IBA1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and/or morphological changes, including hypertrophy, proliferation, and modifications of glial networks); (2) phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways; (3) upregulation of adenosine triphosphate and chemokine receptors and hemichannels and downregulation of glutamate transporters; and (4) synthesis and release of glial mediators (eg, cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and proteases) to the extracellular space. Although widely detected in chronic pain resulting from nerve trauma, inflammation, cancer, and chemotherapy in rodents, and more recently, human immunodeficiency virus-associated neuropathy in human beings, glial reaction (activation state 1) is not thought to mediate pain sensitivity directly. Instead, activation states 2 to 4 have been demonstrated to enhance pain sensitivity via a number of synergistic neuro-glial interactions. Glial mediators have been shown to powerfully modulate excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission at presynaptic, postsynaptic, and extrasynaptic sites. Glial activation also occurs in acute pain conditions, and acute opioid treatment activates peripheral glia to mask opioid analgesia. Thus, chronic pain could be a result of \"gliopathy,\" that is, dysregulation of glial functions in the central and peripheral nervous system. In this review, we provide an update on recent advances and discuss remaining questions.",

European American, Mexican American, and African American women (N = 758) were surveyed before and after viewing either a narrative or non-narrative cervical cancer-related film. The narrative was more effective in increasing cervical cancer-related knowledge and attitudes. Moreover, in response to the narrative featuring Latinas, Mexican Americans were most transported, identified most with the characters, and experienced the strongest emotions. Regressions revealed that transportation, identification with specific characters, and emotion each contributed to shifts in knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intentions. Thus, narrative formats may provide a valuable tool in reducing health disparities.",

While the widespread adoption of genomic technologies including chromatin immunoprecipitation with massively parallel short-read sequencing (ChIP-seq) has allowed for the interrogation of chromatin structure on a genome-wide scale, rDNA had not until recently been analyzed by this technique. We now extend genomic analysis of rDNA to mouse (Mus musculus), where rDNA is similar in structure to but highly divergent in sequence from human rDNA. Comparison of rDNA histone marks between mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and more differentiated mouse cell types reveals differences between pluripotent and differentiated states. We also observe substantial divergence in rDNA histone modification patterns between mESCs and human ESCs (hESCs). Surprisingly, we find that the pluripotency factor OCT4 is bound to rDNA in similar patterns in both mESCs and hESCs. Extending this analysis, we find that an additional seventeen pluripotency-associated factors are bound to rDNA in mESCs, suggesting novel modes of rDNA regulation in pluripotent cells. Taken together, our results provide a detailed view of rDNA chromatin structure in an important model system and enable high-resolution comparison of rDNA regulation between mouse and human.",

        "abstract": "Carbon ion irradiation is an emerging therapeutic option for various tumor entities. Radiation resistance of solid tumors toward photon irradiation is caused by attenuation of DNA damage in less oxygenated tumor areas and by increased hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 signaling. Carbon ion irradiation acts independently of oxygen; however, the role of HIF-1 is unclear. We analyzed the effect of HIF-1 signaling after carbon ions in comparison to photons by using biological equivalent radiation doses in a human non-small-cell cancer model. The studies were performed in cultured A549 and H1299 cell lines and in A549 xenografts. Knockdown of HIF-1α in vivo combined with photon irradiation delayed tumor growth (23 vs. 13 d; P<0.05). Photon irradiation induced HIF-1α and target genes, predominantly in oxygenated cells (1.6-fold; P<0.05), with subsequent enhanced tumor angiogenesis (1.7-fold; P<0.05). These effects were not observed after carbon ion irradiation. Micro-DNA array analysis indicated that photons, but not carbon ions, significantly induced components of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway (gene set enrichment analysis; P<0.01) as relevant for HIF-1α induction. After carbon ion irradiation in vivo, we observed substantially decreased HIF-1α levels (8.9-fold; P<0.01) and drastically delayed tumor growth (P<0.01), an important finding that indicates a higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) than anticipated from the cell survival data. Taken together, the evidence showed that carbon ions mediate an improved therapeutic effectiveness without tumor-promoting HIF-1 signaling.-Subtil, F. S.

        "abstract": "Background: The development and progression of true-interval breast cancers (tumors that truly appear after a negative screening mammogram) is known to be different than screen-detected cancers. However, the worse clinical behavior is not fully understood from a biological basis. We described the differential patterns of gene expression through microarray analysis in true-interval and screen-detected cancers. Methods:An unsupervised exploratory gene expression profile analysis was performed in 10 samples (true-interval cancers=5; screen-detected cancers=5) using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0ST arrays and interpreted by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Differential expression of selected genes was confirmed in a validation series of 91 tumors (n=12; n=79) by immunohistochemistry and in 24 tumors (n=8; n=16) by RT-qPCR, in true-interval and screen-detected cancers, respectively. Results: Exploratory gene expression analysis identified 1060 differentially expressed genes (unadjusted p<0.05) between study groups. Based on biological implications, four genes were further validated: ceruloplasmin (CP) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70kDa, polypeptide 2 (RPS6KB2) both upregulated in true interval cancers and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and transforming growth factor beta receptor III (TGFBR3), downregulated in true-interval cancers. Their differential expression was confirmed by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry, consistent with mTOR pathway overexpression in true-interval cancers. Conclusions: True-interval and screen-detected cancers show differential expression profile both at gene and protein levels. The mTOR signaling is significantly upregulated in true-interval cancers, suggesting this pathway may mediate their aggressiveness. Impact: Linking epidemiological factors and mTOR activation may be the basis for future personalized screening strategies in women at risk of true-interval cancers.",

The objective of this study is to identify serum autoantibody biomarkers that can be used to improve prognostication for patients affected with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Study Design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: A panel of 130 serum biomarkers, previously selected for cancer detection using microarray-based serological profiling and specialized bioinformatics, were evaluated for their potential as prognostic biomarkers in a cohort of 119 HNSCC patients followed for up to 12.7 years. A biomarker was considered positive if its reactivity to the particular patient's serum was greater than one standard deviation above the mean reactivity to sera from the other 118 patients, using leave-one-out cross-validation model. Survival curves were estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and statistically significant differences in survival were examined using the log-rank test. Independent prognostic biomarkers were identified following analysis using Multivariate Cox proportional-hazards models. Results: Poor overall survival was associated with African-Americans (hazard ratio [HR] for death=2.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.58-4.33; P=0.000), advanced stage (HR=2.79; 95% CI, 1.40-5.57; P=0.004), and recurrent disease (HR=6.66; 95% CI, 2.54-17.44; P=0.000). On Multivariable Cox analysis adjusted for covariates (race and stage), 6 of the 130 markers evaluated were found to be independent prognosticators of overall survival. Conclusions: The results shown here are promising and demonstrate the potential use of serum biomarkers for prognostication in HNSCC patients. Further clinical trial to include larger sample of patients across multiple centers may be warranted.",

Of the four mammalian EHD proteins, EHD2 appears to be the most disparate, both in terms of sequence homology, and in subcellular localization/function. Since its initial description as a plasma membrane-associated protein, the precise function of EHD2 has remained enigmatic. Various reports have suggested roles for EHD2 at the plasma membrane, within the endocytic transport system, and even in the nucleus. For example, EHD2 facilitates membrane fusion/repair in muscle cells. Recently the focus has shifted to the role of EHD2 in regulating caveolae. Indeed, EHD2 is highly expressed in tissues rich in caveolae, including fat, muscle and blood vessels. This review highlights cumulative evidence linking EHD2 to actin-rich structures at the plasma membrane, where the plasma membrane-associated phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate controls EHD2 recruitment. Herein we examine the key pathways where EHD2 might function, and address its potential involvement in these processes.",

        "title": "Comprehensive metagenomic analysis of glioblastoma reveals absence of known virus despite antiviral-like type I interferon gene response.",
        "abstract": "Glioblastoma is a deadly malignant brain tumor, and one of the most incurable forms of cancer in need of new therapeutic targets. As some cancers are known to be caused by a virus, the discovery of viruses could open the possibility to treat, and perhaps prevent, such a disease. Although an association with viruses such as cytomegalovirus or Simian virus 40 has been strongly suggested, involvement of these and other viruses in the initiation and/or propagation of glioblastoma remains vague, controversial, and warrants elucidation. To exhaustively address the association of virus and glioblastoma, we developed and validated a robust metagenomic approach to analyze patient biopsies via high-throughput sequencing, a sensitive tool for virus screening. In addition to traditional clinical diagnostics, glioblastoma biopsies were deep-sequenced and analyzed with a multi-stage computational pipeline to identify known or potentially discover unknown viruses. In contrast to the studies reporting the presence of viral signatures in glioblastoma, no common or recurring active viruses were detected, despite finding an anti-viral-like type I interferon response in some specimens. Our findings highlight a discrete and non-specific viral signature and uncharacterized short RNA sequences in glioblastoma. This study provides new insights into glioblastoma pathogenesis and defines a general methodology that can be used for high-resolution virus screening and discovery in human cancers. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Regorafenib, a novel multikinase inhibitor, has recently demonstrated overall survival benefits over best supportive care in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. This study aimed to gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms of regorafenib and to assess its potential in combination therapy. Regorafenib was tested alone and in combination with irinotecan in patient-derived (PD) CRC models and a murine CRC liver metastasis model. Mechanism of action was investigated using in vitro functional assays, immunohistochemistry and correlation with CRC-related oncogenes. Regorafenib demonstrated significant inhibition of growth-factor-mediated vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 2 and VEGFR3 autophosphorylation, and intracellular VEGFR3 signaling in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HuVECs) and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), and also blocked migration of LECs. Furthermore, regorafenib inhibited proliferation in 19 out of 25 human CRC cell lines and markedly slowed tumor growth in five out of seven patient-derived xenograft models. Combination of regorafenib with irinotecan significantly delayed tumor growth after extended treatment in four xenograft models. Reduced CD31 staining indicates that the antiangiogenic effects of regorafenib contribute to its antitumor activity. Finally, regorafenib significantly prolonged disease progression in a murine CRC liver metastasis model by inhibiting growth of established liver metastases and preventing formation of new metastases in other organs. In addition, our results suggest that regorafenib displays antimetastatic activity, which may contribute to its efficacy in patients with metastatic CRC. Combination of regorafenib and irinotecan demonstrated an increased antitumor effect, and could provide a future treatment option for CRC patients. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

In addition, the expression of Usp28 protein in 186 bladder cancers was also determined by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between expression of Usp28 and clinico-pathologic features and prognosis was finally evaluated. Usp28 was expressed at a higher level in bladder cancers compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues at both the mRNA and protein levels in 24 paired samples (all P < 0.01). In immunohistochemical examination, 78 (41.9 %) of 186 cases displayed low Usp28 expression in cancerous tissues, whereas 108 (58.1 %) cases displayed high Usp28 expression. In the universal analysis, Usp28 correlated strongly with histopathological grade, clinical stage, tumor number and recurrence rate (P = 0.0001, 0.0001, 0.0001 and 0.0051, respectively), but did not correlate with gender or age (P = 0.5588 and 0.6574). After multiple analysis of the above factors and consideration of confounding factors, tumor number, histological grade, clinical stage, and recurrence were related to Usp28 expression (P = 0.001, 0.001, 0.001 and 0.001, respectively). Finally, Usp28 expression was indentified as a independent predictors of survival (P = 0.001). Usp28 protein expression is potentially valuable in prognostic evaluation of bladder cancer.",

With this in mind, we performed this meta-analysis with 11 studies including 3,797 cases and 5,094 controls for Asp312Asn and 21 studies including 6,360 cases and 7,894 controls for Lys751Gln polymorphism. We searched available literatures from PubMed, Embase, and CBM databases. Crude odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the strength of the associations. Moreover, to validate biological plausibility of our findings, the effects of these two polymorphisms on XPD gene expression within three ethnicities was determine by gene expression analysis based on imputed genotypes from HapMap. Overall, the variant allele of Asp312Asn polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer (Asn/Asn vs. Asp/Asp: OR = 1.51, 95 % CI = 1.19-1.91; Asp/Asn vs. Asp/Asp: OR = 1.23, 95 % CI = 1.12-1.35; recessive model: OR = 1.33, 95 % CI = 1.10-1.61; dominant model: OR = 1.32, 95 % CI = 1.14-1.52; and allele comparing: OR = 1.26, 95 % CI = 1.11-1.42). We found the Lys751Gln was associated with increased bladder cancer risk only under the recessive model (OR = 1.14, 95 % CI = 1.01-1.29). Stratification analyses demonstrated an increased risk for Asians and hospital-based studies under all genetic models while only under the dominant model for Caucasians as to the Asp312Asn polymorphism and for Caucasians under the recessive model as to the Lys751Gln polymorphism. We also found the Asp312Asn polymorphism can significantly influence mRNA expression levels among Asians and Caucasians, and the Lys751Gln polymorphism has a similar effect for Caucasians. Despite some limitations, this meta-analysis suggests that polymorphisms in XPD gene may contribute to bladder cancer susceptibility. These findings need further validation by large well-designed prospective studies.",

To confirm if these two autoantibodies are specific for certain types of malignant tumors, the present work was thus undertaken to examine an alteration of anti-CD25 and anti-FOXP3 IgG levels in breast cancer. A total of 152 patients with breast cancer and 112 control subjects were recruited in this study. The levels of circulating anti-CD25 and anti-FOXP3 IgG antibodies were tested using an in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Student's t test showed no significant differences in the levels of either anti-CD25 IgG or anti-FOXP3 IgG between patients with breast cancer and control subjects, although patients at stage I had increased levels of anti-CD25 IgG compared with control subjects (t = 2.11, P = 0.037); there was no significant association of the anti-FOXP3 IgG levels with stages of breast cancer. In conclusion, circulating IgG autoantibody to CD25 instead of FOXP3 may be a potential biomarker for early diagnosis of breast cancer but further investigation remains needed to replicate this initial finding.",

        "abstract": "Peritoneal dissemination is the most frequent metastatic pattern of advanced gastric cancer and the main cause of death in gastric cancer patients. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF- ß1), one of the most potent fibrotic stimuli for human peritoneal mesothelial cells, has been shown to play an important role in this process. In this study, we investigated the effect of TGF- ß1 signaling blockade in gastric cancer cell (GCC)-induced human peritoneal mesothelial cell (HPMC) fibrosis. HPMCs were cocultured with the high TGF- ß1 expressing GCC line SGC-7901 and various TGF- ß1 signaling inhibitors or SGC-7901 transfected with TGF-ß1-specific siRNA. HPMC fibrosis was monitored on the basis of morphology. Expression of the epithelial cell marker, E-cadherin, and the mesenchymal marker, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), was evaluated by Western blotting and immunofluorescence confocal imaging. GCC adhesion to HPMC was also assayed. In nude mouse tumor model, the peritoneal fibrotic status was monitored by immunofluorescent confocal imaging and Masson's trichrome staining; formation of metastatic nodular and ascites fluid was also evaluated. Our study demonstrated that GCC expressing high levels of TGF-ß1 induced HMPC fibrosis, which is characterized by both upregulation of E-cadherin and downregulation of α-SMA. Furthermore, HPMC monolayers fibrosis was reversed by TGF- ß1 signaling blockade. In vivo, the TGF- ß1 receptor inhibitor SB-431542 partially attenuated early-stage gastric cancer peritoneal dissemination (GCPD). In conclusion, our study confirms the significance of TGFß1 signaling blockade in attenuating GCPD and may provide a therapeutic target for clinical therapy.",

We investigated the voice outcomes of subligamentous cordectomy of progressive anterior-posterior extent of excision. Study Design: Physical phonatory modeling Methods: The influence of vocal fold surgical defects and corresponding scar was experimentally investigated using a self-oscillating physical model of the vocal folds and compared with the baseline model without defects or scar. Results: Results showed that increasing anterior-posterior extent of resection increased phonation threshold pressure and flow rate and reduced excitation of high-order harmonics, resulting a more breathy and rough voice production. However, it was found out that voice production was improved with the placement of scar, which increased both excitation of high-order harmonics and the harmonic-to-noise ratio. Conclusions: Though large anterior-posterior surgical resections resulted in progressive impact on vocal measures, a limited excision of the vocal fold cover surprisingly demonstrated minimal voice changes. Further investigations are required to define the acceptable extent of surgical resection which may result in optimal voice outcomes.",

        "abstract": "We evaluated the overall coverage, frequency and costs of Pap testing by screening modality and health care provider in Finland. Information about Pap testing in the Finnish female population of 2.7 million was obtained from nationwide population-based registry data. Among women aged 25-69 years, 87% had had a Pap test taken within or outside the organised programme at least once during the last 5 years and half of those screened in the organised programme had also had at least one Pap test taken outside the programme. Of the annual average of 530,000 Pap tests taken, 84% were taken for screening purposes and 16% as follow-up. Forty percent of the 446,000 annual screening tests were taken in the organised programme, 55% as opportunistic tests in public primary or student health care or by private providers and 5% in public secondary health care. One-fifth of all opportunistic screening Pap tests were taken from women aged <25. The voluminous opportunistic Pap testing in public primary health care was concentrated in young women aged 25-29 whereas the bulk of opportunistic testing in private health occurred in age groups eligible for organised screening. The total cost of all screening Pap tests was €22.4 million, of which 71% incurred in opportunistic screening. Of the 84,000 annual follow-up Pap tests and their €8.3 million total costs, ∼60% incurred in organised screening or in secondary health care.",

Methods: Fifty patients were recruited prospectively to two groups (exercise/EX group: n=26 and repetitive swallow/SW group: n=24). Functional Oral Intake Scale scores and PEG placements were compared at post-treatment and at 3 months. Results: The EX group eliminated significantly more PEG tubes at 3 months post-treatment compared to the SW group (16% vs. 50%). Among patients who received both radiation and chemotherapy, the EX group had significantly less PEG tubes immediately post-treatment as well as 3 months post-treatment (35% & 10%), compared to the SW group (69% & 50%). Conclusions: Findings indicate significant benefits of the EX group's exercise regimen in reducing PEG dependence and oral intake difficulties. Head Neck, 2013.",

Over 2 years, 120 co-survivors participated in the intervention. The majority of participants (96 %) were women and all but one reported being Hispanic. Both in years 1 and 2, we followed the same pre- and post-intervention evaluation design. Based on pre- and post-intervention assessments of cancer-related knowledge and self-efficacy, the percentage of questions answered correctly about cancer significantly increased for co-survivors. Self-efficacy significantly increased as well. Using item analysis, we explored skill teaching as a mechanism for the effective delivery of Un Abrazo and recommend the use of promotoras in providing the intervention. Of the 12 cancer knowledge items resulting in statistically significant increases of cancer knowledge, 5 were taught via interactive skill teaching. Given the projected rise in the incidence of cancer in Hispanic populations, coupled with the fact that people from low-income backgrounds face unique challenges in cancer prevention and management, implications of the Un Abrazo model for future research and policy regarding cancer and families are considered.",

        "abstract": "The inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) cycloaddition between 1,2,4,5-tetrazines and strained alkene dienophiles is an emergent variety of catalyst-free 'click' chemistry that has the potential to have a transformational impact on the synthesis and development of radiopharmaceuticals. The ligation is selective, rapid, high-yielding, clean, and bioorthogonal and, since its advent in 2008, has been employed in a wide variety of chemical settings. In radiochemistry, the reaction has proven particularly useful with (18)  F and has already been utilized to create a number of (18)  F-labeled agents, including the PARP1-targeting small molecule (18)  F-AZD2281, the αv β3 integrin-targeting peptide (18)  F-RGD, and the GLP-1-targeting peptide (18)  F-exendin. The inherent flexibility of the ligation has also been applied to the construction of radiometal-based probes, specifically the development of a modular strategy for the synthesis of radioimmunoconjugates that effectively eliminates variability in the construction of these agents. Further, the exceptional speed and biorthogonality of the reaction have made it especially promising in the realm of in vivo pretargeted imaging and therapy, and pretargeted imaging strategies based on the isotopes (111) In, (18)  F, and (64) Cu have already proven capable of producing images with high tumor contrast and low levels of uptake in background, nontarget organs. Ultimately, the characteristics of inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder click chemistry make it almost uniquely well-suited for radiochemistry, and although the field is young, this ligation has the potential to make a tremendous impact on the synthesis, development, and study of novel radiopharmaceuticals.",

The majority of these studies are conducted in young adults. This analysis in a large (n= 769) sample of postmenopausal women (median age 63y) sought to 1) confirm that sleep duration and sleep quality are negatively correlated with circulating leptin concentrations and 2) to examine the relationship between self-reported sleep, dietary energy intake, and diet quality, as well as, investigate the role of leptin in these associations. Design and Methods: Sleep duration/ quality, insomnia, and dietary intake were determined via self-report. Blood samples were collected following an overnight fast to assess serum leptin concentration. All analyses were adjusted for total body fat mass. Results: Women reporting ≤6h sleep/night had lower serum leptin concentrations than those reporting ≥8h sleep (P= 0.04). Furthermore, those with ≤6h sleep/night reported higher dietary energy intake (p=0.01) and lower diet quality (P= 0.04) than the reference group (7h sleep/night). Women sleeping ≥8h also reported lower diet quality than the reference group (P= 0.02). Importantly, serum leptin did not confound these associations. Conclusions: These results provide evidence that sleep duration is inversely associated with serum leptin and dietary energy intake in postmenopausal women.",

        "abstract": "Prohibitins are members of a highly conserved protein family containing the stomatin/prohibitin/flotillin/HflK/C (SPFH) domain [also known as the prohibitin (PHB) domain] found unicellular eukaryotes, fungi, plants, animals and humans. Two highly homologous members of prohibitins expressed in eukaryotes are prohibitin (PHB; B-cell receptor associated protein-32, BAP-32) and prohibitin 2/repressor of estrogen receptor activity (PHB2, REA, BAP-37). Both PHB and REA/PHB2 are ubiquitously expressed and are present in multiple cellular compartments including the mitochondria, nucleus, and the plasma membrane. Multiple functions have been attributed to the mitochondrial and nuclear PHB and PHB2/REA including cellular differentiation, anti-proliferation, and morphogenesis. One of the major functions of the prohibitins are in maintaining the functional integrity of the mitochondria and protecting cells from various stresses. In the present review, we focus on the recent research developments indicating that PHB and PHB2/REA is involved in maintaining cellular survival through the Ras-Raf-MEK-Erk pathway. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which the intracellular signaling pathways utilize prohibitins in governing cellular survival is likely to result in development of therapeutic strategies to overcome various human pathological disorders such as diabetes, obesity, neurological diseases, inflammatory bowel disease and cancer.

        "abstract": "Rational treatment for neoplasms of the duodenal papilla (NDPs) is still controversial, especially for early stage lesions. Total papillectomies are indicated in patients expected to have adenomas, adenocarcinoma in an adenoma, or mucosal adenocarcinomas with no lymph node metastases. However, the preoperative pathological evaluation of NDPs is still challenging and often inaccurate, mainly because of the complicated anatomical structures involved and the possibility of an adenocarcinoma in an adenoma. Herein, we introduce a new method of total papillectomy, the extraduodenal papillectomy (ExDP). In this method, papillectomy is undertaken from outside of the duodenum, instead of resection from the inside through a wide incision of the duodenal wall as is done in conventional transduodenal papillectomy (TDP). The advantages of ExDP are precise and deeper cutting of the sphincter and shorter exploration time of the tumor compared to conventional TDP. We demonstrate three representative patients, all of whom had an uneventful postoperative course. One of them subsequently underwent a pylorus preserving pancreatoduodenectomy after detailed postoperative pathological evaluation. Including that patient, no recurrence has occurred with 37-46 months of follow-up. In conclusion, ExDP is regarded as a \"total biopsy\" for early stage borderline lesions and a feasible, less demanding alternative method for the treatment of NDPs.",

        "abstract": "The double-strand RNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR, plays a central role in inflammatory/chronic stress-mediated pathologies such as cancer, diabetes, and neuro/muscular degenerative diseases. Although a significant amount of research has been conducted to elucidate the role of PKR signaling in the cytosol, only recently has attention been paid to the role of PKR in the nuclear compartment. Previously our group reported that phosphorylated forms of PKR are present in the nucleus of acute leukemic cell lines, representing a reservoir of active kinase that responds to stress. Using the CCRF-CEM acute T-cell leukemia cell line, a PKR-specific inhibitor, co-immunoprecipitation and a proteomics approach, which included affinity purified mass spectrometry analysis (AP/MS), we identified the proteins present in active and inactive PKR nuclear complexes. Of the proteins identified in the PKR complexes, sixty-nine (69) were specific to the active complex, while thirty-eight (38) were specific to the inactive complex. An additional thirteen (13) proteins associated specifically with both complexes. The majority of the proteins identified are involved in, ribosome biogenesis, RNA splicing, mRNA stability, gene expression, cell cycle, or chromatin organization, including several with known significance to normal hematopoiesis and/or hematological disease. In agreement with the AP/MS data, basal- or over-expression of PKR under normal growth conditions favored cell proliferation in the tested cell lines, whereas pharmacological inhibition of PKR or shRNA-mediated knock-down did not. PKR was also found to influence the isoform and the level of expression of the proto-oncogene MYC. J. Cell. Physiol. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Our study aims to propose a new method based on cyclodextrin polymer (polyCD) functionalized hydroxyapatite (HA) for achieving a high local drug concentration with a sustained release profile and a better control of residual malignant cells via local drug delivery and promotion of the reconstruction of bone defects. PolyCD, a versatile carrier for therapeutic molecules, can be incorporated into HA (bone regeneration scaffold) through thermal treatment. The parameters of polyCD treatment on the macroporous HA (porosity 65%) were characterized via thermogravimetric analysis. Good cytocompatibility of polyCD functionalized bioceramics was demonstrated on osteoblast cells by cell vitality assay. An antibiotic (gentamicin) and an anticancer agent (cisplatin) were respectively loaded on polyCD functionalized bioceramics for drug release test. The results show that polyCD functionalization leads to significantly improved drug loading quantity (30% more concerning gentamicin and twice more for cisplatin) and drug release duration (7 days longer concerning gentamicin and 3 days longer for cisplatin). Conclusively, this study offers a safe and reliable drug delivery system for bioceramic matrices, which can load anticancer agents (or/and antibiotics) to reduce local recurrence (or/and infection). © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "abstract": "Ferritin levels and trends are widely used to manage iron overload and assess the efficacy of prescribed iron chelation in patients with transfusional iron loading. A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 134 patients with transfusion-dependent anemia, over a period of up to 9 years. To determine if the trends in ferritin adequately reflect the changes in total body iron, changes in ferritin between consecutive liver iron measurements by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were compared to changes in liver iron concentrations (LIC), a measure of total body iron. The time period between two consecutive LIC measurements was defined as a segment. Trends in ferritin were considered to predict the change in LIC within a segment if the change in one parameter was less than two fold that of the other, and was in the same direction. Using the exclusion criteria detailed in methods, the trends in ferritin were compared to changes in LIC in 358 segments. An agreement between ferritin trends and LIC changes was found in only 38% of the 358 segments examined. Furthermore, the change in ferritin was in opposite direction to that of LIC in 26% of the segments. Trends in ferritin were a worse predictor of changes in LIC in sickle cell disease than in thalassemia (p<0·01).While ferritin is a convenient measure of iron status; ferritin trends were unable to predict changes in LIC in individual patients. Ferritin trends need to be interpreted with caution and confirmed by direct measurement of LIC.",

        "abstract": "Tumor-stroma interactions contribute greatly to intratumoral estrogen biosynthesis in endometrial carcinoma, but the mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. Previous study demonstrated that intratumoral aromatase upregulation in stromal cells participated in this process, but the specific aromatase-regulators have not been reported. In the present study, we found that aromatase expression in intratumoral stroma, but not in tumor epithelium, correlated positively with interleukin (IL)-6 expression in cancer epithelial cells by immunohistochemistry, which was confirmed using laser capture microdissection/ real-time reverse transcription-PCR. With stimulation by exogenous IL-6, aromarase expression was increased in stromal cells not but not in cancer cells. Aromatase mRNA levels in endometrial cancer cells were not influenced by cocultivation with intratumoral stromal cells. When cocultured with 17β-estradiol (E2 )-treated cancer cells, aromatase mRNA in stromal cells was significantly elevated and increased IL-6 protein levels were detected in E2 -treated culture medium. Next, we demonstrated that E2 -induced IL-6 production was through cooperation between estrogen receptor α and nuclear factor-kappa B. Furthermore, an IL-6 receptor blocking antibody could attenuate the upregulation of aromatase expression in stromal cells and the E2 concentration in coculture systems of cancer and stromal cells. The results were confirmed by an orthotopic nude endometrial carcinoma model in vivo. These studies elucidated the activation of a positive feedback loop, that is, IL-6 stimulated by E2 in endometrial cancer cells induced aromatase expression in stromal cells, promoting enhanced intratumoral E2 synthesis. Blocking of this tumor-stroma interaction may be a therapeutic strategy to overcome in situ estrogen biosynthesis in endometrial carcinoma. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Bladder cancer (BC) is the fifth most common cancer in the world, being the non-muscle invasive tumors (NMIBC) the most frequent. NMIBC shows a very high frequency of recurrence and, in certain cases, tumor progression. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, which controls cell growth, tumorigenesis, cell invasion and drug response, is frequently activated in numerous human cancers, including BC, in part through alterations of PIK3CA gene. However, the significance of PIK3CA gene alterations with respect to clinicopathological characteristics, and in particular tumor recurrence and progression, remains elusive. Here, we analyzed the presence of mutations in FGFR3 and PIK3CA genes and copy number alterations of PIK3CA gene in bladder tumor and their correspondent paired normal samples from 87 patients. We observed an extremely high frequency of PIK3CA gene alterations (mutations, copy gains, or both) in tumor samples, affecting primarily T1 and T2 tumors. A significant number of normal tissues also showed mutations and copy gains, being coincident with those found in the corresponding tumor sample. In low-grade tumors PIK3CA mutations associated with FGFR3 mutations. Alterations in PIK3CA gene resulted in increased Akt activity in tumors. Interestingly, the presence of PIK3CA gene alterations, and in particular gene mutations, is significantly associated with reduced recurrence of NMIBC patients. Importantly, the presence of FGFR3 mutations may influence the clinical outcome of patients bearing alterations in PIK3CA gene, and increased recurrence was associated to FGFR3 mutated, PIK3CA wt tumors. These findings may have high relevance in terms of using PI3K-targeted therapies for BC treatment. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Acute chemotherapy can induce rapid bone-marrow derived pro-angiogenic cell (BMDC) mobilization and tumor homing, contributing to tumor regrowth. In order to study the contribution of tumor cells to tumor regrowth following therapy, we focused on tumor-derived microparticles (TMPs). EMT/6 murine-mammary carcinoma cells exposed to paclitaxel chemotherapy exhibited an increased number of TMPs and significantly altered their angiogenic properties. Similarly, breast cancer patients had increased levels of plasma MUC-1+TMPs following chemotherapy. In addition, TMPs from cells exposed to paclitaxel induced higher BMDC mobilization and colonization but had no increased effect on angiogenesis in Matrigel plugs and tumors than TMPs from untreated cells. Since TMPs abundantly express osteopontin, a protein known to participate in BMDC trafficking, the impact of osteopontin-depleted TMPs on BMDC mobilization, colonization, and tumor angiogenesis was examined. While EMT/6 tumors grown in mice inoculated with osteopontin-depleted TMPs had lower numbers of BMDC infiltration and microvessel density compared with EMT/6 tumors grown in mice inoculated with wild-type TMPs, no significant difference in tumor growth was seen between the two groups. However, when BMDCs from paclitaxel-treated mice were injected into wild-type EMT/6-bearing mice, a substantial increase in tumor growth and BMDC infiltration was detected compared to osteopontin-depleted EMT/6-bearing mice injected with BMDCs from paclitaxel-treated mice. Collectively, our results suggest that osteopontin expressed by TMPs play an important role in BMDC mobilization and colonization of tumors, but is not sufficient to enhance the angiogenic activity of BMDCs in tumors. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Nanoparticle tracking analysis revealed that Exo(Hypoxic) have smaller average size as compared to Exo(Normoxic) . Immunoblotting results showed a higher level of tetraspanins (CD63 and CD81), heat shock proteins (HSP90 and HSP70), and Annexin II in Exo(Hypoxic) compared to Exo(Normoxic) . Co-culturing with Exo(Hypoxic) increased the invasiveness and motility of naïve LNCaP and PC3 cells, respectively. Exo(Hypoxic) also promoted prostasphere formation by both LNCaP and PC3 cells, and enhanced α-SMA (a CAF biomarker) expression in PrSC. Compared to Exo(Normoxic) , Exo(Hypoxic) showed higher metalloproteinases activity and increased level of diverse signaling molecules (TGF-β2, TNF1α, IL6, TSG101, Akt, ILK1, and β-catenin). Furthermore, proteome analysis revealed a higher number of proteins in Exo(Hypoxic) (160 proteins) compared to Exo(Normoxic) (62 proteins), primarily associated with the remodeling of epithelial adherens junction pathway. Importantly, Exo(Hypoxic) targeted the expression of adherens junction proteins in naïve PC3 cells. These findings suggest that Exo(Hypoxic) are loaded with unique proteins that could enhance invasiveness, stemness, and induce microenvironment changes; thereby, promoting PCA aggressiveness. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "title": "The lymphocyte/monocyte ratio predicts poor clinical outcome and improves the predictive accuracy in patients with soft tissue sarcomas.",
        "abstract": "Increasing evidence indicates the involvement of inflammation and coagulation in cancer progression and metastases. Inflammatory biomarkers hold great promise for improving the predictive ability of existing prognostic tools in cancer patients. In the present study, we investigated several inflammatory indices with regard to their prognostic relevance for predicting clinical outcome in soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients. Three hundred forty STS patients were divided into a training set (n=170) and a validation set (n=170). Besides well-established clinico-pathological prognostic factors, we evaluated the prognostic value of the neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L) ratio, the lymphocyte/monocyte (L/M) ratio and the platelet/lymphocyte (P/L) ratio using Kaplan-Meier curves and univariate as well as multivariate Cox regression models. Additionally, we developed a nomogram by supplementing the L/M ratio to the well-established Kattan nomogram and evaluated the predictive accuracy of this novel nomogram by applying calibration and Harrell's concordance index (c-index). In multivariate analysis, a low L/M ratio was significantly associated with decreased CSS and DFS (HR=0.41, 95%CI=0.18-0.97, p=0.043; HR=0.39, 95%CI=0.16-0.91, p=0.031, respectively) in the training set. Using the validation set for confirmation, we found also in multivariate analysis an independent value for CSS (HR=0.33, 95%CI=0.12-0.90, p=0.03) and for DFS (HR=0.36, 95%CI=0.16-0.79, p=0.01). The estimated c-index was 0.74 using the original Kattan nomogram and 0.78 when the L/M ratio was added. Our study reports for the first time that the pre-operative L/M ratio represents a novel independent prognostic factor for prediction the clinical outcome in STS patients. This easily determinable biomarker might be helpful in improved individual risk assessment. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "DNA copy number alterations (CNAs), including amplifications and deletions, can result in significant changes in gene expression and are closely related to the development and progression of many diseases, especially cancer. For example, CNA-associated expression changes in certain genes (called candidate tumor driver genes) can alter the expression levels of many downstream genes through transcription regulation and cause cancer. Identification of such candidate tumor driver genes leads to discovery of novel therapeutic targets for personalized treatment of cancers. Several approaches have been developed for this purpose by using both copy number and gene expression data. In this study, we propose a Bayesian approach to identify candidate tumor driver genes, in which the copy number and gene expression data are modeled together, and the dependency between the two data types is modeled through conditional probabilities. The proposed joint modeling approach can identify CNA and differentially expressed genes simultaneously, leading to improved detection of candidate tumor driver genes and comprehensive understanding of underlying biological processes. We evaluated the proposed method in simulation studies, and then applied to a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma data set. Both simulation studies and data application show that the joint modeling approach can significantly improve the performance in identifying candidate tumor driver genes, when compared with other existing approaches.

        "abstract": "The aim of this study is to clarify the prognostic importance of several well-known but still debated pathological variables related to the survival of colon cancer patients. The study focuses on the definition and survival carried by the pT4 category and stage II where the presence of high-risk variables may determine whether or not adjuvant chemotherapy is administered. A retrospective nationwide study was carried out including all colon cancer patients that underwent resection in Iceland between 1990 and 2004 (n =889). All histopathology was reassessed. Cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival were analysed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis. In stage II, the 5-year CSS for pT4 was 50% (95% CI, 32-69%), which was the lowest survival observed in that stage. In stage III the 5-year CSS was 30% (95% CI, 18-41%) and 37% (95% CI, 26-48%) for pT4 and pN2 tumors, respectively. Lymphatic invasion and differentiation had no prognostic value in stage II. The survival associated with pT4a versus pT4b depends on how these categories are defined with regard to Shepherd's local peritoneal involvement (LPI). In the present series pT4 is a major indicator of poor prognosis in patients with stage II and III colon carcinoma. Four-tiered TNM or Dukes staging systems are insufficient by not taking this variable into account. Only Shepherd's LPI4 and a subgroup of LPI3 (i.e. borderline LPI3/LPI4) should qualify for the pT4a subcategory. The results do not support lymphatic invasion or poor differentiation as high-risk stage II variables. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play important roles in activation of immunoreaction and tumor development. Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), one of the TLRs binding with single-stranded RNA, activates intracellular pathways and stimulates the release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines. In this study, we investigated the impact of the TLR7-signaling pathway on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 15 (IL-15), which have been testified to refer to the immunomodulating and tumor progression. We confirmed that the TLR7 was expressed by Hela cells, despite the abundance was weak. Gardiquimod, one of the TLR7 ligands, can promote these five genes expression in varying degrees. After stimulating with gardiquimod, the expression of the IL-15V1, 3 increased about 4.5 times on RNA level, the other expression was only up-regulated about 2 times. We also discovered that gardiquimod could activate the MAPK/ERK- and PI3K/AKT-signaling pathways, and the specific inhibitors studies indicate that, the effect of gardiquimod on these genes expression is mainly or partially dependent on the activation of these two signaling pathways. To sum up, the activation of TLR7 signaling pathway may modulate some genes expression in Hela cells and may contribute to the pathogenesis of the cervical cancer.",

Support teams are a unique model of peer support for persons facing serious illness, but research is rare. This study sought to (a) implement new volunteer support teams for African Americans with advanced cancer in two distinct regions and (b) evaluate support teams' ability to improve support, awareness of services, and quality of life for these patients. Methods. The study used a pre-post design. Community and academic partners collaborated to implement volunteer support teams and evaluate the intervention using pre-post surveys of volunteers and patients. Patients who declined support teams were also interviewed as a comparison group. Results. Investigators enrolled and trained 130 volunteers who formed 25 support teams in two geographic regions. Volunteers supported 25 African American patients with advanced cancer (72%) or other diseases. After 2 months, patients with support teams reported fewer needs for practical, emotional, and spiritual support on a structured checklist. They more often communicated with someone about their cancer care needs (48% vs. 75%, p = .04), and were more aware of Hospice (4% vs. 25%, p = .04), but quality of life scores were unchanged. Comparison patients who refused a support team had fewer support needs at baseline and follow-up, suggesting that refusals were based on a lack of need. Conclusion. Coordinated volunteer support teams are a promising new model to provide peer support for African Americans facing cancer and other serious illnesses. Further testing in a pragmatic clinical trial is warranted.",

Recently, a consensus definition on cachexia has been reached, leading to a growing interest by the scientific community in this condition, which characterizes the last phase of many chronic diseases (i.e., cancer, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). The etiology of cachexia is multifactorial and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are essentially the following: anorexia and malnourishment; immune overactivity and systemic inflammation; and endocrine disorders (anabolic/catabolic imbalance and resistance to growth hormone). In this paper, we review the main pathophysiological mechanisms underlying CHF cachexia, focusing also on the broad spectrum of actions of ghrelin and ghrelin agonists, and their possible use in combination with physical exercise to contrast CHF cachexia.",

        "abstract": "Thymidylate synthase (TS), a critical enzyme for DNA synthesis and repair is both a potential tumor prognostic biomarker as well as a tumorgenic oncogene in animal models. We have now studied the clinical implications of TS expression in gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and compared these results with other cell cycle biomarker genes. Protein tissue arrays were used to study TS, Ki-67, Rb, pRb, E2F1, p18, p21, p27, and menin expression in 320 human GEP-NETs samples. Immunohistochemical expression was correlated with univariate and multivariate predictors of survival utilizing Kaplan Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Real time RT-PCR was used to validate these findings. We found that 78 of 320 GEP-NETs (24.4%) expressed TS. NETs arising in the colon, stomach, and pancreas showed the highest expression of TS (47.4%, 42.6%, and 37.3%, respectively), whereas NETs of the appendix, rectum, and duodenum displayed low TS expression (3.3%, 12.9%, and 15.4%, respectively). TS expression in GEP-NETs was associated with poorly differentiated endocrine carcinoma, angiolymphatic invasion, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis (p < 0.05). Patients with TS-positive NETs had markedly worse outcomes than TS-negative NETs as shown by univariate (p < 0.001) and multivariate (p = 0.01) survival analyses. Expression of p18 predicted survival in TS-positive patients that received chemotherapy (p = 0.015). In conclusion, TS protein expression was an independent prognostic biomarker for GEP-NETs. The strong association of increased TS expression with aggressive disease and early death supports the role of TS as a cancer promoting agent in these tumors. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Cancer cachexia (CC), a syndrome characterized by anorexia and body weight loss due to low fat-free mass levels including reduced musculature, markedly worsens patient quality of life. Although stomach cancer patients have the highest incidence of cachexia, few experimental models for the study of stomach CC have been established. Herein, we developed stomach CC animal models using nude rats subcutaneously implanted with 2 novel cell lines: MKN45c185, established from the human stomach cancer cell line MKN-45, and 85As2, derived from peritoneal dissemination of orthotopically implanted MKN45c185 cells in mice. Both CC models showed marked weight loss, anorexia, reduced musculature and muscle strength, increased inflammatory markers, and low plasma albumin; however, CC developed earlier and was more severe in rats implanted with 85As2 than in those implanted with MKN45cl85. Moreover, human leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a known cachectic factor, and hypothalamic orexigenic peptide mRNAs were increased in the models, whereas hypothalamic anorexigenic peptide mRNAs were decreased. Surgical removal of the tumor not only abolished cachexia symptoms but also reduced plasma LIF levels to below detectable limits. Importantly, oral administration of rikkunshito, a traditional Japanese medicine, substantially ameliorated CC-related anorexia and body composition change. In summary, our novel peritoneal dissemination-derived 85As2 rat model developed severe cachexia, possibly caused by LIF from cancer cells, that was ameliorated by rikkunshito. This model should provide a useful tool for further study into the mechanisms and treatment of stomach CC.",

        "abstract": "Genomic and epigenomic studies of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are reshaping our understanding of the disease and have provided new perspectives for a more individualized diagnosis and new potential therapeutic targets. In this study, the global promoter methylation profile was determined in highly purified B-cells from 37 (Binet stage A) CLL patients, using high-resolution methylation microarrays (27,578 CpG). Overall, the methylation pattern correlated with the major biological (ZAP-70 and CD38), and molecular (IGHV mutation) markers, distinguishing CLL cases according to IGHV mutational status. Cell adhesion molecules were enriched in the signature of unmutated (UM) versus mutated (M-) CLL. Moreover, in M-CLL CpG hyper-methylation in three genes, including SPG20, was significantly anti-correlated with the corresponding gene expression level. Finally, the correlation between the methylation pattern and clinical parameters was investigated. Notably, out of 42 methyl-probes that were significantly associated with progression free survival (PFS), hyper-methylation of SPG20 was also positively associated with PFS. These data support the notion that epigenetic changes have clinical impact in CLL and may contribute to the identification of novel candidate disease-associated genes potentially useful to predict the clinical outcome of early stage CLL patients. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

RasGAP is also a caspase-3 substrate. One of the caspase-3-generated RasGAP fragments, corresponding to amino acids 158-455 and called fragment N2, was previously reported to specifically sensitize cancer cells to death induced by various anticancer agents. Here we show that fragment N2 inhibits migration in vitro and that it impairs metastatic progression of breast cancer to the lung. Hence, stress-activated caspase-3 might contribute to the suppression of metastasis through the generation of fragment N2. These results indicate that the activity borne by fragment N2 has a potential therapeutic relevance to counteract the metastatic process. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "The interaction between cancer cells and their microenvironment is a paradoxical cycle that exacerbates cancer progression and results in metastasis. The current study investigated the mechanism underlying the synergistic enhancement of release of soluble factors from tumor-associated dendritic cells and its effect on cancer development. The combination of HB-EGF and CXCL5 produced a strong synergistic effect on cancer proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration and invasion. CXCL5 not only potentiated the classical EGFR pathway and the AKT and ERK/RSK1/2 signaling pathways, but also increased the phosphorylation of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), which was slightly increased in A549 cells treated with either HB-EGF or CXCL5 only. Phosphorylated HSP27 stabilized sustained AKT activity by direct interaction, leading to enhanced tumor spheroid formation. Knockdown of HSP27 by shRNA decreased HB-EGF plus CXCL5-mediated tumor spheroid formation in a 3D culture system, suggesting that AKT/HSP27 was required for HB-EGF/CXCL5-mediated cancer progression. Inhibiting RSK also reduces the modulation of c-Fos phosphorylation, Snail up-regulation and cell migration by HB-EGF plus CXCL5, suggesting a synergistic effect of ERK/RSK and HB-EGF plus CXCL5 on cell migration. In mice, CXCL5 antibody synergistically enhances the efficiency of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, gefitinib, without increasing its toxicity. These results provide evidence that elucidates potential cross-points between extracellular signals affecting lung cancer progression. Targeting CXCL5 may provide therapeutic benefits for lung cancer chemo- or immuno-therapy. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "While statin intake has been proven to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), the mechanism of anti-tumor effects and clinical significance in survival benefits remain unclear. Statin-induced anti-proliferative effects and its underlying mechanism were examined using 6 CRC cell lines. Statins except pravastatin showed anti-proliferative effects (simvastatin ≥ fluvastatin > atorvastatin) even though both of simvastatin and pravastatin could activate mevalonate pathways, suggesting the statin-mediated anti-proliferative effects depended on non-mevalonate pathway. Indeed, statin induced p27KIP1 expression by down-regulation of histone methyltransferase Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which acts as an epigenetic gene silencer. Additionally, the use of simvastatin plus classII histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (MC1568) induced further overexpression of p27KIP1 by inhibiting HDAC5 induction originated from down-regulated EZH2 in CRC cells, and synergistically led to considerable anti-proliferative effects. In the clinical setting, Statin intake (except pravastatin) displayed the downregulated EZH2 expression and inversely upregulated p27KIP1 expression in the resected CRC by immunohistochemical staining, and resulted in the significantly better prognoses both in overall survival (p=0.02) and disease free survival (p<0.01) compared to patients without statin intake. Statins may inhibit tumor progression via an EZH2-mediated epigenetic alteration, which results in survival benefits after resected CRC. Furthermore, statin plus classII HDAC inhibitor could be a novel anti-cancer therapy by their synergistic effects in CRC. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Methotrexate (MTX) chemotherapy is known to cause bone loss which lacks specific preventative treatments, although clinically folinic acid is often used to reduce MTX toxicity in soft tissues. This study investigated damaging effects of MTX injections (0.75 mg/kg/day for 5 days) in rats and potential protective benefits of fish oil (0.25, 0.5, or 0.75 ml/100 g/day) in comparison to folinic acid (0.75 mg/kg) in the tibial metaphysis. MTX treatment significantly reduced height of primary spongiosa and volume of trabecular bone while reducing density of osteoblasts. Consistently, MTX reduced osteogenic differentiation but increased adipogenesis of bone marrow stromal cells, accompanied by lower mRNA expression of osteogenic transcription factors Runx2 and Osx, but an up-regulation of adipogenesis-related genes FABP4 and PPAR-γ. MTX also increased osteoclast density, bone marrow osteoclast formation, and mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, and RANKL/OPG ratio in bone. Fish oil (0.5 or 0.75 ml/100 g) or folinic acid supplementation preserved bone volume, osteoblast density, and osteogenic differentiation, and suppressed MTX-induced cytokine expression, osteoclastogenesis, and adipogenesis. Thus, fish oil at 0.5 ml/100 g or above is as effective as folinic acid in counteracting MTX-induced bone damage, conserving bone formation, suppressing resorption and marrow adiposity, suggesting its therapeutic potential in preventing bone loss during MTX chemotherapy. © 2013 Orthopaedic Research Society.

We examined differences in treatment receipt and survival among African-American (AA) and Non-Hispanic White (NHW) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients residing in Southwest Georgia (SWGA)-a primarily rural 33-county area; population 700,000. Medical records for 934 SWGA NSCLC patients diagnosed in 2001-2003 were used to extract information on age, race, marital status, insurance coverage, comorbidities, and treatment. Information pertaining to socioeconomic status, urban/rural residence, and survival was obtained from the cancer registry. Multivariable logistic regression analyses examined the relation of various patient and disease characteristics to receipt of tumor-directed therapy. Cox regression models were used to assess determinants of survival. Treatment receipt was associated with age, marital status, comorbidities, and disease stage in most analyses. No associations were observed between race and either surgery [odds ratio (OR) 0.83, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.49-1.39] or radiation (OR 0.72; 95 % CI 0.52-1.00). NHW patients were more likely to receive no treatment at all (OR 1.50, 95 % CI 1.01-2.23). There was no racial difference in survival (hazard ratio = 1.07, 95 % CI 0.90-1.26). Effects of insurance and treatment on survival were most pronounced within 6 months post-diagnosis, but were attenuated over time. We found no evidence of racial disparities in survival and, in some analyses, a decreased likelihood of treatment receipt among NHW NSCLC patients compared to AA. The results from SWGA stand in contrast to studies that applied different methodologies and were conducted elsewhere.",

To clarify whether women using anticoagulant treatment at the time of biopsy have a lower occurrence of lymph node metastasis, we conducted a nationwide Swedish cohort study of 26,528 female incident breast cancer patients in 2006 -2011. Point risk ratio (RR) of risk of lymph node metastasis among users of anticoagulant treatment adjusted for adjusted for age, T-stage, socioeconomic factors and concomitant medication was RR=0.94, 95% CI: 0.87-1.03), and lower in younger women (RR=0.80, 95% CI 0.50-1.29). Although non-significant, these associations may underestimate a true negative association since women using anticoagulant treatment are likely to have more concomitant diseases, lead an unhealthier lifestyle, and have lower participation in mammography screening. These findings provide some support for the hypothesis that anticoagulant medications might counteract breast cancer spread caused by needle biopsy. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

In this study we investigated whether alterations in the TopBP1 gene can influence the risk of endometrial cancer. We examined the association between five single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs185903567, rs116645643, rs115160714, rs116195487, and rs112843513) located in the 3'UTR region of the TopBP1 gene and endometrial cancer risk as well as allele-specific gene expression. One hundred twenty-one endometrial cancer patients were genotyped for these SNPs. Allele-specific TopBP1 mRNA and protein expressions were determined by real time PCR and western blotting methods, respectively. Only one SNP (rs115160714) showed an association with endometrial cancer. Compared to homozygous common allele carriers, heterozygous for the T variant had significantly increased risk of endometrial cancer [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 5.59, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.96-15.91, p = 0.0003]. Mean TopBP1 mRNA and protein expression were higher in the individuals with the CT genotype. There was a significant association between the rs115160714 and tumor grade and FIGO classification. Most carriers of minor allele had a high grade tumors (G3) classified as FIGO III/IV. The results of our study raise a possibility that a genetic variation of TopBP1 may be implicated in the etiology of endometrial cancer.",

        "abstract": "The management of acute ischemic stroke during anticoagulation with a novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) is challenging because intravenous thrombolysis is contraindicated because of a putative increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhagic complications. We examined the risk of secondary postischemic hemorrhage after thrombolysis in rodents pretreated with rivaroxaban or warfarin. Mice were pretreated with either rivaroxaban (30 mg/kg), warfarin (target international normalized ratio 2 to 3) or vehicle. After 2 or 3 hours, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), mice received 9 mg/kg recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. Twenty-four hours after MCAO, secondary hemorrhage was quantified using a macroscopic hemorrhage score and hemoglobin spectrophotometry. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability was measured by Evans Blue spectrofluorometry. To increase the validity of our findings, experiments were also performed using a thromboembolic model in anticoagulated rats. Infarct size did not differ among groups. Pretreatment with warfarin led to significantly more secondary hemorrhage compared with rivaroxaban and nonanticoagulated controls after 2- and 3-hour ischemia in mice as well as in rats. Blood-brain barrier permeability was significantly higher in the warfarin group compared with rivaroxaban and control. Thus, rivaroxaban in contrast to warfarin does not increase secondary hemorrhage after thrombolysis in experimental cerebral ischemia. Less effects of rivaroxaban on postischemic BBB permeability may account for this difference.Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism advance online publication, 18 December 2013; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2013.226.",

        "abstract": "With improvements in the detection and treatment of breast cancer, more women are surviving after diagnosis. Patients who complete adjuvant therapy require ongoing follow-up to manage toxicities, to detect recurrences early, and to provide ongoing physical and psychosocial support. Routine surveillance should be implemented, with attention to educating patients about symptoms of recurrence, such as weight loss, cough, and bone pain. An intensive surveillance strategy with the routine use of laboratory and radiographic studies does not improve outcomes and raises the cost of follow-up. Patients should have annual mammograms in conjunction with physical exam and history at appropriate intervals that increase the farther out patients are from treatment. Attention also should be focused on other routine health maintenance and cancer screening, such as colonoscopy, gynecologic examinations, and bone health/DEXA scans. In the early posttreatment period, medical oncologists are best equipped to follow these patients. However, as women live longer after a breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, transitioning care to a primary care physician or nurse practitioner is appropriate, provided these practitioners are educated about late treatment effects and managing side effects of treatment, which may continue as long as a decade. A multidisciplinary follow-up strategy with excellent communication between providers can ensure safe, convenient, and quality care to the growing population of breast cancer survivors. As the treatment of breast cancer evolves into personalized strategies based on the biologic characteristics of individual tumors, future studies will be needed to determine if a single surveillance strategy is sufficient or if individualized surveillance based on risk can improve outcomes and costs of long-term follow-up care.",

Here we investigate the cytotoxicity of F10 towards GBM cells and evaluate the anti-tumor activity of locally-administered F10 towards an orthotopic xenograft model of GBM. The effects of F10 on thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibition and Topoisomerase 1 (Top1) cleavage complex formation were evaluated using TS activity assays and in vivo complex of enzyme bioassays. Cytotoxicity of F10 towards normal brain was evaluated using cortices from embryonic (day 18) mice. F10 displays minimal penetrance of the blood-brain barrier and was delivered by intra-cerebral (i.c.) administration and prospective anti-tumor response towards luciferase-expressing G48a human GBM tumors in nude mice was evaluated using IVIS imaging. Histological examination of tumor and normal brain tissue was used to assess the selectivity of anti-tumor activity. F10 is cytotoxic towards G48a, SNB-19, and U-251 MG GBM cells through dual targeting of TS and Top1. F10 is not toxic to murine primary neuronal cultures. F10 is well-tolerated upon i.c. administration and induces significant regression of G48a tumors that is dose-dependent. Histological analysis from F10-treated mice revealed tumors were essentially completely eradicated in F10-treated mice while vehicle-treated mice displayed substantial infiltration into normal tissue. F10 displays strong efficacy for GBM treatment with minimal toxicity upon i.c. administration establishing F10 as a promising drug-candidate for treating GBM in human patients.",

        "abstract": "Genomic resources developed for domesticated species provide powerful tools for studying the evolutionary history of their wild relatives. Here we use 61K single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) evenly spaced throughout the canine nuclear genome to analyse evolutionary relationships among the three largest European populations of grey wolves in comparison with other populations worldwide, and investigate genome-wide effects of demographic bottlenecks and signatures of selection. European wolves have a discontinuous range, with large and connected populations in Eastern Europe and relatively smaller, isolated populations in Italy and the Iberian Peninsula. Our results suggest a continuous decline in wolf numbers in Europe since the Late Pleistocene, and long-term isolation and bottlenecks in the Italian and Iberian populations following their divergence from the Eastern European population. The Italian and Iberian populations have low genetic variability and high linkage disequilibrium, but relatively few autozygous segments across the genome. This last characteristic clearly distinguishes them from populations that underwent recent drastic demographic declines or founder events, and implies long-term bottlenecks in these two populations. Although genetic drift due to spatial isolation and bottlenecks seems to be a major evolutionary force diversifying the European populations, we detected 35 loci that are putatively under diversifying selection. Two of these loci flank the canine platelet-derived growth factor gene, which affects bone growth and may influence differences in body size between wolf populations. This study demonstrates the power of population genomics for identifying genetic signals of demographic bottlenecks and detecting signatures of directional selection in bottlenecked populations, despite their low background variability.Heredity advance online publication, 18 December 2013; doi:10.1038/hdy.2013.122.",

        "abstract": "Background/Objectives:The objective of this study was to describe serum lipid concentrations, including apolipoproteins A-I and B, in different diet groups.Subjects/Methods:A cross-sectional analysis of a sample of 424 meat-eaters, 425 fish-eaters, 423 vegetarians and 422 vegans, matched on sex and age, from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Oxford cohort. Serum concentrations of total, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, as well as apolipoproteins A-I and B were measured, and serum non-HDL cholesterol was calculated.Results:Vegans had the lowest body mass index (BMI) and the highest and lowest intakes of polyunsaturated and saturated fat, respectively. After adjustment for age, alcohol and physical activity, compared with meat-eaters, fish-eaters and vegetarians, serum concentrations of total and non-HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were significantly lower in vegans. Serum apolipoprotein A-I concentrations did not differ between the diet groups. In males, the mean serum total cholesterol concentration was 0.87 nmol/l lower in vegans than in meat-eaters; after further adjustment for BMI this difference was 0.76 nmol/l. In females, the difference in total cholesterol between these two groups was 0.60 nmol/l, and after further adjustment for BMI was 0.55 nmol/l.Conclusions:In this study, which included a large number of vegans, serum total cholesterol and apolipoprotein B concentrations were lower in vegans compared with meat-eaters, fish-eaters and vegetarians. A small proportion of the observed differences in serum lipid concentrations was explained by differences in BMI, but a large proportion is most likely due to diet.European Journal of Clinical Nutrition advance online publication, 18 December 2013; doi:10.1038/ejcn.2013.248.",

Here we show that data derived from non-microdissected glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumor tissue is either masked or not accurate, producing correlations between genomic and proteomic data that lead to false classifications for therapeutic stratification. We analyzed the level of 133 key signaling proteins and phosphoproteins in laser capture-microdissected (LCM) primary tumors from a study set of tissues used for TCGA profiling efforts, comparing the results to tissue-matched, non-tumor cell enriched lysates from adjacent sections. Among the analytes, 44%, including targets for clinically important inhibitors, such as phosphorylated MTOR, AKT, STAT1, VEGFR2 or BCL2, differed between matched tumor cell-enriched and non-enriched specimens (even in tumor sections with 90% tumor cell content). While total EGFR protein levels were higher in tumors with EGFR mutations, regardless of tumor cell enrichment, EGFR phosphorylation was increased only in LCM-enriched tumor specimens carrying EGFR mutations. Phosphorylated and total PTEN, which is highly expressed in normal brain, was reduced only in LCM-enriched tumor specimens with either PTEN mutation or loss in PTEN copy number, with no differences observed in non-microdissected samples. These results were confirmed in an independent, non-microdissected, publicly available protein data set from the TCGA database. Our findings highlight the necessity for careful upfront cellular enrichment in biospecimens that form the basis for targeted therapy selection, and for molecular characterization efforts such as TCGA.",

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for these changes have not been fully defined. Here we report that anti-VEGF therapy promotes local invasion and metastasis by inducing collagen signaling in cancer cells. We show that chronic VEGF inhibition in a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) induces hypoxia, a less differentiated mesenchymal-like tumor cell phenotype, TGFβ expression, and collagen deposition and signaling. Additionally, we show that collagen signaling is critical for pro-tumorigenic activity of TGFβ in vitro. To further model the impact of collagen signaling in tumors, we evaluated PDA in mice lacking Sparc, a protein that reduces collagen binding to cell surface receptors. Importantly, we show that loss of Sparc increases collagen signaling and tumor progression. Together, these findings suggest that collagen actively promotes PDA spread and that enhanced disease progression associated with anti-VEGF therapy can arise from elevated ECM-mediated signaling.",

        "abstract": "Chromosomal instability is central to the process of carcinogenesis. The genome-wide detection of somatic chromosomal alterations (SCAs) in small premalignant lesions remains challenging since sample heterogeneity dilutes the aberrant cell information. To overcome this hurdle, we focused on the B allele frequency data from single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays (SNP arrays). The difference of allelic fractions between paired tumor and normal samples from the same patient (delta-θ) provides a simple but sensitive detection of SCA in affected tissue. We applied the delta-θ approach to small, heterogeneous clinical specimens including endobronchial biopsies and brushings. Regions identified by delta-θ were validated by FISH and qPCR in heterogeneous samples. Distinctive genomic variations were successfully detected across the whole genome in all invasive cancer cases (6/6), carcinoma in situ (3/3), and high grade dysplasia (severe or moderate) (3/11). Not only well-described SCAs in lung squamous cell carcinoma, but also several novel chromosomal alterations were frequently found across the pre-invasive dysplastic cases. Within these novel regions, losses of putative tumor suppressors (RNF20 and SSBP2) and an amplification of RASGRP3 gene with oncogenic activity were observed. Widespread sampling of the airway during bronchoscopy demonstrated that field cancerization reflected by SCAs at multiple sites was detectable. SNP arrays combined with delta-θ analysis can detect SCAs in heterogeneous clinical sample and expand our ability to assess genomic instability in the airway epithelium as a biomarker of lung cancer risk.",

        "abstract": "Urinary bladder cancer prevention studies were performed with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) naproxen (standard NSAID with a good cardiovascular profile), sulindac, and their nitric oxide (NO) derivatives. Additionally, the effects of the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor, difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), alone or combined with a suboptimal dose of naproxen or sulindac was examined. Agents were evaluated at their human equivalent doses (HEDs), as well as at lower doses. In the hydroxybutyl(butyl)nitrosamine (OH-BBN) model of urinary bladder cancer, naproxen (400 or 75 ppm) and sulindac (400 ppm) reduced the incidence of large bladder cancers by 82, 68 and 44%, respectively, when the agents were initially given 3 months after the final dose of the carcinogen; microscopic cancers already existed. NO-naproxen was highly effective, while NO-sulindac was inactive. To further compare naproxen and NO-naproxen, we examined their effects on gene expression in rat livers following a 7 day exposure. Limited, but similar, gene expression changes in the liver were induced by both agents, implying that the primary effects of both are mediated by the parent NSAID. When agents were initiated 2 weeks after the last administration of OH-BBN, DFMO at 1000 ppm had limited activity, a low dose of naproxen (75 ppm) and sulindac (150 ppm) were highly and marginally effective. Combining DFMO with suboptimal doses of naproxen had minimal effects whereas the combination of DMFO and sulindac was more active than either agent alone. Thus, naproxen and NO-naproxen were highly effective, while sulindac was moderately effective in the OH-BBN model at their HEDs.",

It has also been reported that tumour stromal fibroblasts are necessary for steps in cancer progression, such as angiogenesis. There have been few reports of a correlation between fibroblast actions and IL-6 levels. In this study, we examined the correlation between cancer stromal fibroblasts and IL-6 and the utility of IL-6 as a therapeutic target in human colon cancer.Methods:The expression levels of IL-6 and VEGF of fibroblasts and cancer cell lines were evaluated using real-time PCR and ELISA. The anti-angiogenic effect of inhibiting IL-6 signalling was measured in an angiogenesis model and animal experiment.Results:We demonstrate that stromal fibroblasts isolated from colon cancer produced significant amounts of IL-6 and that colon cancer cells enhanced IL-6 production by stromal fibroblasts. Moreover, IL-6 enhanced VEGF production by fibroblasts, thereby inducing angiogenesis. In vivo, anti-IL6 receptor antibody targeting stromal tissue showed greater anti-tumour activity than did anti-IL6 receptor antibody targeting xenografted cancer cells.Conclusion:Cancer stromal fibroblasts were an important source of IL-6 in colon cancer. IL-6 produced by activated fibroblasts induced tumour angiogenesis by stimulating adjacent stromal fibroblasts.

Activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) contributes to HCC development and progression. Wild-type HBx has been demonstrated to activate HIF-1α, but the effect of HBx mutations on HIF-1α has not been elucidated.Methods:HBx mutations were identified by gene sequencing in 101 HCC tissues. Representative HBx mutants were cloned and transfected into HCC cells. Expression and activation of HIF-1α were analysed by western blot and luciferase assays, respectively. The relationship between HBx mutants and HIF-1α expression in HCC tissues was also evaluated.Results:The dual mutations K130M/V131I enhanced the functionality of HBx as they upregulated the expression and transcriptional activity of HIF-1α. The C-terminal truncations and deletion mutations, however, weakened the ability of HBx to upregulate HIF-1α. Meanwhile, the C-terminus was further found to be essential for the stability and transactivation of HBx. In the HCC tissues, there was a positive association between the HBx mutants and HIF-1α expression.Conclusion:Different mutations of HBx exert differentiated effects on the functionality of HIF-1α, however, the overall activity of HBx mutants appears to increase the expression and transcriptional activity of HIF-1α.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 17 December 2013; doi:10.1038/bjc.2013.787 www.bjcancer.com.",

Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with HER3 and PTEN antibodies were conducted retrospectively.Results:Patients who had negative HER3 staining (62.4%) had a better progression-free survival (PFS) than did those who had positive HER3 staining (P=0.001; median PFS, 21 vs 11 months). Patients who had a PTEN score >20 (78.1%) showed longer PFS than did those with a PTEN score 20 (P=0.006; median PFS, 13 vs 9 months). Patients who had a PTEN score >20 exhibited a longer overall survival (OS) than did those with a PTEN score 20 (P=0.005; median OS, 48 vs 25 months). HER3 negativity and PTEN loss were identified as independent risk factors for PFS. PTEN loss was identified as an independent risk factor for OS.Conclusion:HER3 and PTEN expressions may be predictive markers, and PTEN expression may be a predictive and prognostic biomarker for trastuzumab treatment in HER2-positive MBCs.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 17 December 2013; doi:10.1038/bjc.2013.757 www.bjcancer.com.",

In this paper, we describe updates to the BOADICEA model that extend its capabilities, make it easier to use in a clinical setting and yield more accurate predictions.Methods:We describe: (1) updates to the statistical model to include cancer incidences from multiple populations; (2) updates to the distributions of tumour pathology characteristics using new data on BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers and women with breast cancer from the general population; (3) improvements to the computational efficiency of the algorithm so that risk calculations now run substantially faster; and (4) updates to the model's web interface to accommodate these new features and to make it easier to use in a clinical setting.Results:We present results derived using the updated model, and demonstrate that the changes have a significant impact on risk predictions.Conclusion:All updates have been implemented in a new version of the BOADICEA web interface that is now available for general use: http://ccge.medschl.cam.ac.uk/boadicea/.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 17 December 2013; doi:10.1038/bjc.2013.730 www.bjcancer.com.",

        "abstract": "Background:Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial programme in cancer metastasis. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a key inducer of EMT, and Ezrin has an important role in this process. However, how Ezrin is activated and whether it mediates EGF-induced EMT in tongue squamous cell carcinomas (TSCCs) through activating NF-κB remains obscure.Methods:We used two TSCC cell lines as a cell model to study invasion and EMT in vitro, and used nude mice xenografts model to evaluate metastasis of TSCC cells. Finally, we evaluated the level of pEzrin Tyr353, nuclear p65 and EMT markers in TSCC clinical samples.Results:Ezrin Tyr353 was phosphorylated through Akt (but not ERK1/2, ROCK1) pathway, and lead to the activation of NF-κB in EGF-treated TSCC cells. Akt and NF-κB inhibitors blocked EGF-induced EMT, and suppressed invasion and migration of TSCC cells. In vivo, silencing Ezrin significantly suppressed EGF-enhanced metastasis of TSCC xenografts. Finally, high levels of expression of pEzrin Tyr353, nuclear p65, vimentin and low level of expression of E-cadherin were correlated with cancer metastasis and poor patient prognosis.Conclusion:Our data suggest that Akt/Ezrin Tyr353/NF-κB pathway regulates EGF-induced EMT and metastasis inTSCC, and Ezrin may serve as a therapeutic target to reverse EMT in tongue cancers and prevent TSCC progression.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 17 December 2013; doi:10.1038/bjc.2013.770 www.bjcancer.com.",

The mechanisms by which microRNA-9 contributes to medulloblastoma pathogenesis remain unclear, and factors that regulate this process have not been delineated.Methods:Expression and methylation status of microRNA-9 in medulloblastoma cell lines and primary samples were analysed. The association of microRNA-9 expression with medulloblastoma patients' clinical outcome was assessed, and the impact of microRNA-9 restoration was functionally validated in medulloblastoma cells.Results:microRNA-9 expression is repressed in a large subset of MB samples compared with normal fetal cerebellum. Low microRNA-9 expression correlates significantly with the diagnosis of unfavourable histopathological variants and with poor clinical outcome. microRNA-9 silencing occurs via cancer-specific CpG island hypermethylation. HES1 was identified as a direct target of microRNA-9 in medulloblastoma, and restoration of microRNA-9 was shown to trigger cell cycle arrest, to inhibit clonal growth and to promote medulloblastoma cell differentiation.Conclusions:microRNA-9 is a methylation-silenced tumour suppressor that could be a potential candidate predictive marker for poor prognosis of medulloblastoma. Loss of microRNA-9 may confer a proliferative advantage to tumour cells, and it could possibly contribute to disease pathogenesis. Thus, re-expression of microRNA-9 may constitute a novel epigenetic regulation strategy against medulloblastoma.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication 17 December 2013; doi:10.1038/bjc.2013.764 www.bjcancer.com.",

        "abstract": "Aim To quantify the effect of food on the systemic exposure of lapatinib at steady state when administered 1 h before and after meals, and to observe the safety and tolerability of lapatinib under these conditions in patients with advanced solid tumours. Methods This was a three-treatment, randomised, three-sequence cross-over study. Lapatinib was administered 1 h after a low- [B] or a high-fat [C] meal and systemic exposure was compared with that obtained following administration 1 h before a low-fat meal [A]. Results In total, 25 patients were included, of whom 12 were evaluable for the pharmacokinetic analysis. Both low-fat and high-fat meals affected lapatinib exposure. Lapatinib AUC0-24 increased following lapatinib administration 1 h after a low-fat meal by 1.80-fold (90 % CI: 1.37-2.37) and after a high-fat meal by 2.61-fold (90 % CI: 1.98-3.43). Lapatinib Cmax increased following lapatinib administration 1 h after a low-fat meal by 1.90-fold (90 % CI: 1.49-2.43) and after a high-fat meal by 2.66-fold (90 % CI: 2.08-3.41). The most commonly occurring treatment-related toxicity was diarrhoea (8/25, 32 % CTCAE grade 1 and 2/25, 8 % grade 2) and one treatment-related grade ≥ 3 event occurred (fatigue grade 3, 4 %). Conclusions Both low-fat and high-fat food consumed 1 h before lapatinib administration increased lapatinib systemic exposure compared with lapatinib administration 1 h before a low-fat meal. In order to administer lapatinib in a fasted state, it is advised to administer the drug 1 h before a meal.",

Transmucosal oral/nasal fentanyl formulations are commonly used in clinical practice. The different methods of release influence the pharmacokinetics and clinical properties of these formulations. The aim of this review was to assess and weigh these differences. Clinical trials comparing one transmucosal fentanyl with placebo or another active drug were included. We searched Medline for the last ten years and analyzed 13 studies, totaling 1447 patients. Clinical data on efficacy and safety were compared. In parallel, we report the differences in delivery systems, bioavailability, maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), plasma half-life, and time to reach Cmax (tmax). Considerable variability emerged between formulations. This suggests some considerations on the choice of the fentanyl formulation in the light of the BTP features in each clinical case.",

        "abstract": "Head or neck location of primary cutaneous melanomas has been described as an adverse prognostic factor, but this has to be reassessed after the introduction of sentinel lymph node (SLN) excision (SLNE). Descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazard models were used to study retrospectively a population of 2302 consecutive melanoma patients from three German melanoma centres undergoing SLNE. Approximately 10% of the patients (N=237) had a primary melanoma located at the head or neck (HNM). In both the SLN-positive and SLN-negative subpopulation, patients with HNM were significantly older, more frequently men and had thicker primaries compared with patients with tumours in other locations. The proportion of positive SLNs was lower in HNM compared with other locations of the primary (20 vs. 26%, P=0.048). The false-negative rate was higher in HNM (17.5 vs. 8.4%, P=0.05). In patients with HNM, the SLN status was a significant factor for recurrence-free survival but not for overall survival. SLN-negative HNM patients had a significantly worse overall survival than the SLN negatives with primaries at other sites, whereas the prognosis of the SLN-positive patients was similar in both groups. The prevalence of lymph node metastases after SLNE is lower in patients with HNM compared with other melanoma locations. As a result, the prognostic information provided by the SLN for HNM seems less important. Decision making for SLNE in HNM should be carefully balanced considering the potential morbidity of the procedure.",

Overexpression of YAP-1 has been linked to tumor progression and worse survival in certain malignancies. However, it has been recently recognized as a tumor suppressor gene as well since it also induces apoptosis. Decreased or absent expression of YAP-1 is highly correlated with tumor progression and worse survival in other tumors such as breast cancer. It is clear that YAP-1 plays a dual role as oncogene and tumor suppressor gene in human oncogenesis, depending on the specific tissue type involved. Here, we reviewed the recent research on both the oncogenic and tumor suppressor function of YAP-1 and its significance in human malignancy. The clinical implication of YAP-1 expression in cancer prognosis and the development of targeted therapy will also be discussed.",

        "abstract": "Since the discovery of microRNAs, non-coding RNAs (NC-RNAs) have increasingly attracted the attention of cancer investigators. Two classes of NC-RNAs are emerging as putative metastasis-related genes: long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). LncRNAs orchestrate metastatic progression through several mechanisms, including the interaction with epigenetic effectors, splicing control and generation of microRNA-like molecules. In contrast, snoRNAs have been long considered \"housekeeping\" genes with no relevant function in cancer. However, recent evidence challenges this assumption, indicating that some snoRNAs are deregulated in cancer cells and may play a specific role in metastasis. Interestingly, snoRNAs and lncRNAs share several mechanisms of action, and might synergize with protein-coding genes to generate a specific cellular phenotype. This evidence suggests that the current paradigm of metastatic progression is incomplete. We propose that NC-RNAs are organized in complex interactive networks which orchestrate cellular phenotypic plasticity. Since plasticity is critical for cancer cell metastasis, we suggest that a molecular interactome composed by both NC-RNAs and proteins orchestrates cancer metastasis. Interestingly, expression of lncRNAs and snoRNAs can be detected in biological fluids, making them potentially useful biomarkers. NC-RNA expression profiles in human neoplasms have been associated with patients' prognosis. SnoRNA and lncRNA silencing in pre-clinical models leads to cancer cell death and/or metastasis prevention, suggesting they can be investigated as novel therapeutic targets. Based on the literature to date, we critically discuss how the NC-RNA interactome can be explored and manipulated to generate more effective diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic strategies for metastatic neoplasms.",

        "abstract": "The dynamics of disease recurrence shows a bimodal pattern with a fairly broad dominant peak at about 1.5-2 years after surgery followed by a second peak at about 5 years. Nowadays, this clinical pattern is explained by assuming that primary breast tumours as well as their metastases have phases of both arrested (tumour dormancy) and active Gompertzian growth. Tumour dormancy at metastatic sites is currently ascribed to biological particularities of local tissue microenvironments that inhibit the growth of tumour cells. However, in some patients, tumour dormancy appears to also depend on the direct interplay between the primary tumour and those metastases, a biological phenomenon called \"concomitant resistance\". Concomitant resistance is related to three biological processes: concomitant immunity, tumour-induced angiogenesis and athrepsia. Concomitant resistance can explain the bimodal relapse pattern of breast cancer patients as well as many other clinical phenomena such as the better clinical outcome among patients surgically treated during the putative early luteal phase, or the worse clinical outcome of African-American premenopausal women. Any therapeutic interventions (even surgery) can affect concomitant resistance with the potential to induce a worse as well as a better clinical outcome. This should be taken into account when planning new treatment strategies.",

Until recently, ethinylestradiol had been almost the only estrogen used for decades, and its dose has been greatly reduced over time. The first generations of birth control pills contained approximately five times more estrogen and four times more progestin than the latest contraceptives. Newer CHCs also contain steroids that more closely mimic the physiological estradiol (E2) and progesterone effects. The newer CHC formulations are thus expected to have less influence on the breast, although it is very difficult to demonstrate any difference among the recent available preparations in human studies. Recently, nomegestrol acetate (NOMAC), a neutral, nonandrogenic, progesterone-like profile progestin, has become available in combination with the 'natural' estrogen, E2. According to the literature, NOMAC/E2 is expected to have either a lesser stimulating effect or a neutral effect on estrogen-sensitive breast cancers. We performed an analysis of the available studies and a bibliographical review. The endocrine and metabolic effects of NOMAC/E2 formulation might lead to a lesser breast tissue stimulation. The data reported, confirmed through clinical studies, should be considered when choosing a hormonal contraceptive, especially when breast stimulation is a concern.",

        "abstract": "Whether wide excision with margins ≥1 cm is sufficient treatment for small low- or intermediate-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is unclear. This is an updated analysis of a phase II, single-arm, prospective trial testing this hypothesis. A total of 158 patients with low- or intermediate-grade DCIS who underwent wide excision alone (without radiation or tamoxifen) were entered onto the trial from 1995 to 2002. Entry criteria included mammographic extent ≤2.5 cm, predominantly low or intermediate nuclear grade, and excision with final microscopic margins ≥1 cm. Eight-year minimum potential follow-up was required for inclusion in the analysis; the final population comprised 143 patients. Cumulative incidence curves were generated to assess rates of local recurrence (LR) or other events. Median follow-up time was 11 years. Nineteen patients (13 %) had LR as a first event within 8 years. Thirteen LR (68 %) were DCIS only and six (32 %) were invasive. Fourteen (74 %) occurred in the original quadrant. The 10-year estimated cumulative incidence of LR was 15.6 %. The estimated annual percentage rate of LR was 1.9 % per patient-year. With longer follow-up, there remains a substantial and ongoing risk of LR in patients with favorable DCIS treated with wide excision margins without radiation. This information should be useful as patients and clinicians weigh the options of wide excision with and without radiation.",

CT is associated with adverse effect on women reproduction and also associated with cervical hypertrophy and induction of squamous metaplasia, providing a possible relationship with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Infection by high-risk HPV types is crucial to the pathogenesis of invasive cervical cancer (ICC), but other co-variants/cofactors must be present for the development of malignancy. CT biological effect may damage the mucosal barrier, improving HPV infection, or may interfere in immune response and viral clearance supporting the persistence of HPV infection. Moreover, CT-related chronic cervical inflammation, decrease of lower genital tract antigen-presenting cells, inhibition of cell-mediated immunity, and anti-apoptotic capacity may influence the natural history of HPV infection, namely persistence progression or resolution. Although several epidemiological studies have stated a positive association involving CT and HPV-related cervical neoplastic lesions and/or cervical cancer (CC), the specific role of this bacterium in the pathogenesis of cervical neoplasia has not been completely clarified. The present review summarizes several studies on CT role in cervical cancer and suggests future research directions on HPV and CT interaction.",

Here we demonstrate that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, primary patient samples, and murine primary xenografts are very sensitive to treatment with the selective BCL-2 antagonist ABT-199. In primary patient cells, the median IC50 was approximately 10 nM, and cell death occurred within 2 h. Our ex vivo sensitivity results compare favorably with those observed for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a disease for which ABT-199 has demonstrated consistent activity in clinical trials. Moreover, mitochondrial studies using BH3 profiling demonstrate activity at the mitochondrion that correlates well with cytotoxicity, supporting an on target mitochondrial mechanism of action. Our protein and BH3 profiling studies provide promising tools that can be tested as predictive biomarkers in any clinical trial of ABT-199 in AML.",

CSCs may be naturally resistant to the cytotoxic effect of radio-chemotherapy because of slow cell cycling, lower proliferation, and increased expression of DNA repair and antiapoptosis genes. To date, a universal marker for CSCs has not been identified. Proposed CSC markers are expressed both by cancer cells as well as by benign stem cells. Although many putative CSC markers exist, a precise characterization for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is lacking.",

In the present study, we synthesized a ternary copolymer mPEG-b-PLL-g-(ss-lPEI), denoted as PLI, by introducing disulfide bond linkages to graft low molecular weight linear polyethylenimine (lPEI) to the block copolymer of poly(l-lysine) (PLL) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) for siRNA delivery. The PLL block and disulfide linkage rendered the carrier biodegradability, while lPEI grafting brought about the proton buffering capacity for lysosomal siRNA release and low cationic toxicity. Conjugation of a single chain monoclonal antibody (Herceptin) to the carrier as a targeting ligand for the Her2/neu receptor significantly increased the transfection activity of the copolymer/siRNA nanocomplex (i.e. the polyplex) in Skov-3, a human ovarian cancer cell line. Determination of gene expression at both the mRNA and protein levels demonstrated that Her2-targeted delivery of siRNA (XIAP siRNA) effectively downregulated the targeted XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) gene, resulting in enhanced cancer cell apoptosis and improved therapeutic efficacy in vitro and in vivo. The distinct features of low cytotoxicity, easy degradability, and high siRNA transfection efficiency make the copolymer a promising candidate for siRNA therapy in tumors.",

Techniques capable of measuring the size and concentration of membrane vesicles directly in biofluids are urgently needed. Fluorescence single particle tracking microscopy has the potential of doing exactly that by labelling the membrane vesicles with a fluorescent label and analysing their Brownian motion in the biofluid. However, an unbound dye in the biofluid can cause high background intensity that strongly biases the fluorescence single particle tracking size and concentration measurements. While such background intensity can be avoided with light sheet illumination, current set-ups require specialty sample holders that are not compatible with high-throughput diagnostics. Here, a microfluidic chip with integrated light sheet illumination is reported, and accurate fluorescence single particle tracking size and concentration measurements of membrane vesicles in cell culture medium and in interstitial fluid collected from primary human breast tumours are demonstrated.",

Detection is based on a surface fluorescence sandwich immunoassay with a limit of detection of ~1 pM for most of the proteins measured: PSA, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. To validate the utility of our platform, we measured these four biomarkers in 20 clinical human serum samples, 10 from prostate cancer patients and 10 female and male controls. We compared the results of our platform to a conventional ELISA and found a good correlation between them. However, compared to a classical ELISA, our device reduces the total cost of reagents by 4 orders of magnitude while increasing throughput by 2 orders of magnitude. Overall, we demonstrate an integrated approach to perform low-cost and rapid quantification of protein biomarkers from over one thousand serum samples. This new high-throughput technology will have a significant impact on disease diagnosis and management.",

        "abstract": "Our objective was to investigate the efficacy and safety of capecitabine maintenance therapy (CMT) after capecitabine-based combination chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The clinical data of 139 metastatic breast cancer patients treated from March 2008 to May 2012 with capecitabine-based combination chemotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. When initial disease control was achieved by the combination chemotherapy, we used CMT for 50 patients, while 37 patients were treated with a different (non-CMT) maintenance therapy. We compared time to progression (TTP), objective response rate, disease control rate, clinical benefit rate, and safety of the two groups, and a sub-group analysis was performed according to pathological characteristics. Sixty-four percent of the patients received a median of six cycles of a docetaxel+capecitabine combination chemotherapy regimen (range 1-45); the median TTP (MTTP) for the complete treatment was 9.43 months (95%CI=8.38-10.48 months) for the CMT group and 4.5 months (95%CI=4.22-4.78 months; P=0.004) for the non-CMT group. The MTTPs for the maintenance therapies administered after the initial capecitabine combined chemotherapy were 4.11 months (95%CI=3.34-4.87 months) for the CMT group and 2.0 months (95%CI=1.63-2.38 months) for the non-CMT group. Gastrointestinal side effects, decreased white blood cells and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia were the main adverse reactions experienced with the combination chemotherapies, CMT and non-CMT treatments. No significant differences in the incidence of adverse reactions were detected in the CMT and non-CMT patients. After initial disease control was achieved with the capecitabine-based combination chemotherapy, CMT can significantly prolong TTP rates with a favorable safety profile.",

        "abstract": "Esophageal cancer (EC) is a common malignancy worldwide. The X-ray repair cross-complementing 1 gene (XRCC1) is one of the most important candidate genes for influencing susceptibility to EC. This study aimed to investigate the effect of XRCC1 genetic variants on susceptibility to EC. A total of 383 EC patients (males: 239, females: 144, mean age: 56.62) and 387 cancer-free controls (males: 251, females: 136, mean age: 58.23) were enrolled in this study. The c.910A>G genetic variant of the XRCC1 gene was determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA sequencing methods. The allele and genotype frequencies indicated statistical differences between EC patients and cancer-free controls. The c.910A>G genetic variant was statistically associated with increased susceptibility to EC [GG vs AA: odds ratio (OR)=1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.12-2.86, P=0.014; GG vs AG/AA: OR=1.76, 95%CI=1.13-2.75, P=0.013; G vs A: OR=1.25, 95%CI=1.01-1.55, P=0.041]. The allele G and genotype GG could contribute to the increased susceptibility to EC. Our findings suggest that the c.910A>G genetic variant is associated with susceptibility to EC in the Chinese Han population, and might be used as a molecular marker for detecting susceptibility to EC.",

Understanding of the natural history of many disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract, including chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer and MALT lymphoma, was altered by this discovery. Interestingly, epidemiological studies have also revealed a correlation between H. pylori infection and some diseases localized outside the stomach, especially those characterized by persistent and low-grade systemic inflammation. Of note, H. pylori has an important role in iron deficiency anaemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and vitamin B12 deficiency. Moreover, the association of this bacterial pathogen with many other diseases, including hepatobiliary, pancreatic, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders is currently under investigation. In this Review, we summarize the results of the most important studies performed to date surrounding the association of H. pylori infection with extragastric diseases, as well as the strength of the evidence. We also provide information concerning bacterial-host interactions and the mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis of each of these extragastric diseases.",

This is remarkable because the same signaling molecules, oncoproteins and tumor suppressors, are well-known targets for cancer therapy. Furthermore, anti-cancer drugs aimed at some of these targets have been already developed. This arsenal could be potentially employed for anti-aging interventions (given that similar signaling molecules are involved in both cancer and aging). In cancer, intrinsic and acquired resistance, tumor heterogeneity, adaptation, and genetic instability of cancer cells all hinder cancer-directed therapy. But for anti-aging applications, these hurdles are irrelevant. For example, since anti-aging interventions should be aimed at normal postmitotic cells, no selection for resistance is expected. At low doses, certain agents may decelerate aging and age-related diseases. Importantly, deceleration of aging can in turn postpone cancer, which is an age-related disease.",

Here, we investigated the expression pattern and biological roles of EZH2 in tongue tumorigenesis by loss-of-function assays using small interference RNA and EZH2 inhibitor DZNep. Also we determined the therapeutic efficiency of DZNep against tongue cancer in vivo. We found that aberrantly overexpressed EZH2 was associated with pathological grade, cervical nodes metastasis and Ki-67 expression in tongue cancers. Elevated EZH2 correlated with shorter overall survival and showed significant and independent prognostic importance in patients with tongue cancer. Both genetic and pharmacological depletion of EZH2 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion and colony formation and decreased CD44+ subpopulation probably in part through modulating p16, p21 and E-caherin. Moreover, DZNep enhanced the anticancer effects of 5-Fluorouracil. Furthermore, intratumoral EZH2 inhibition induced by DZNep intraperitoneal administration significantly attenuated tumor growth in a tongue cancer xenograft model. Taken together, our results indicate that EZH2 serves as a key driver with multiple oncogenic functions during tongue tumorigenesis and a new biomarker for tongue cancer diagnosis and prognostic prediction. These findings open up possibilities for therapeutic intervention against EZH2 in tongue cancer.",

        "abstract": "Antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens threaten public health. Because many antibiotics target specific bacterial enzymes or reactions, corresponding genes may mutate under selection and lead to antibiotic resistance. Accordingly, antimicrobials that selectively target overall microbial cell integrity may offer alternative approaches to therapeutic design. Naturally occurring mammalian α- and θ-defensins are potent, non-toxic microbicides that may be useful for treating infections by antibiotic-resistant pathogens because certain defensin peptides disrupt bacterial, but not mammalian, cell membranes. To test this concept, clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), including vancomycin heteroresistant strains, and ciprofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Cip(R)-PA) were tested for sensitivity to α-defensins Crp-4, RMAD-4 and HNPs 1-3, and to RTD-1, macaque θ-defensin-1. In vitro, 3 μM Crp-4, RMAD-4 and RTD-1 reduced MRSA cell survival by 99%, regardless of vancomycin susceptibility. For PA clinical isolates that differ in fluoroquinolone resistance and virulence phenotype, peptide efficacy was independent of strain ciprofloxacin resistance, site of isolation or virulence factor expression. Thus, Crp-4, RMAD-4 and RTD-1 are effective in vitro antimicrobials against clinical isolates of MRSA and Cip(R)-PA, perhaps providing templates for development of α- and θ-defensin-based microbicides against antibiotic resistant or virulent infectious agents.",

        "abstract": "Fanconi anemia complementation group F protein (FANCF) is a key factor, which maintains the function of FA/BRCA, a DNA damage response pathway. However, the functional role of FANCF in breast cancer has not been elucidated. We performed a specific FANCF-shRNA knockdown of endogenous FANCF in vitro. Cell viability was measured with a CCK-8 assay. DNA damage was assessed with an alkaline comet assay. Apoptosis, cell cycle, and drug accumulation were measured by flow cytometry. The expression levels of protein were determined by Western blot using specific antibodies. Based on these results, we used cell migration and invasion assays to demonstrate a crucial role for FANCF in those processes. FANCF shRNA effectively inhibited expression of FANCF. We found that proliferation of FANCF knockdown breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435S) was significantly inhibited, with cell cycle arrest in the S phase, induction of apoptosis, and DNA fragmentation. Inhibition of FANCF also resulted in decreased cell migration and invasion. In addition, FANCF knockdown enhanced sensitivity to doxorubicin in breast cancer cells. These results suggest that FANCF may be a potential target for molecular, therapeutic intervention in breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "LINE-1 elements make up the most abundant retrotransposon family in the human genome. Full-length LINE-1 elements encode a reverse transcriptase (RT) activity required for their own retrotranpsosition as well as that of non-autonomous Alu elements. LINE-1 are poorly expressed in normal cells and abundantly in cancer cells. Decreasing RT activity in cancer cells, by either LINE-1-specific RNA interference, or by RT inhibitory drugs, was previously found to reduce proliferation and promote differentiation and to antagonize tumor growth in animal models. Here we have investigated how RT exerts these global regulatory functions. We report that the RT inhibitor efavirenz (EFV) selectively downregulates proliferation of transformed cell lines, while exerting only mild effects on non-transformed cells; this differential sensitivity matches a differential RT abundance, which is high in the former and undetectable in the latter. Using CsCl density gradients, we selectively identify Alu and LINE-1 containing DNA:RNA hybrid molecules in cancer but not in normal cells. Remarkably, hybrid molecules fail to form in tumor cells treated with EFV under the same conditions that repress proliferation and induce the reprogramming of expression profiles of coding genes, microRNAs (miRNAs) and ultraconserved regions (UCRs). The RT-sensitive miRNAs and UCRs are significantly associated with Alu sequences. The results suggest that LINE-1-encoded RT governs the balance between single-stranded and double-stranded RNA production. In cancer cells the abundant RT reverse-transcribes retroelement-derived mRNAs forming RNA:DNA hybrids. We propose that this impairs the formation of double-stranded RNAs and the ensuing production of small regulatory RNAs, with a direct impact on gene expression. RT inhibition restores the 'normal' small RNA profile and the regulatory networks that depend on them. Thus, the retrotransposon-encoded RT drives a previously unrecognized mechanism crucial to the transformed state in tumor cells.",

Folate is a vitamin, which is brought into healthy and cancerous cells by folate receptors. The efficiency of silk fibroin-folate nanoparticles loaded with anticancer drug doxorubicin was evaluated by analysing the cell viability, proliferation and endocytosis. Consequently the effects of pro-inflammatory responses by cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β and nitric oxide were checked by stimulating the macrophages with folate conjugated silk fibroin nanoparticles. The fibroin-folate nanocarriers are nontoxic, easily taken up by cells and capable of sustained drug release. Nanoparticles loaded with anticancer drug doxorubicin target cancer cells. The results show that silk fibroin-folate nanoparticles may serve as promising nanocarriers for different biomedical and nanotechnology applications in cancer research.",

        "abstract": "Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) has so far been the most effective immunotherapy for hematological malignancies. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the immunotherapeutic concepts underlying allo-SCT, as well as the traditional dissection of the immune system into innate and adaptive arms, need substantial refinement. More and more cell types migrate into the interface between innate and adaptive immunity, creating new terms such as innate-like lymphocytes. These innate-like cells, which include natural killer (NK) cells and γδT-cells, could provide unique advantages to therapeutic interventions aimed at treating hematological malignancies, including protection against tumor relapse and viral infections without causing harmful graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Recent molecular and conceptual insights into these subpopulations have opened new avenues to exploit their exciting features for the development of new compounds and to revisit current therapeutic standards in the treatment of hematological cancers. This review therefore aims to discuss the rapid progress in the understanding of molecular mechanisms by which NK cells and γδT-cells recognize malignancies and viral infections, and the value of this increasing knowledge to complement the battle against life-threatening complications of current strategies to treat cancer.Leukemia accepted article preview online, 18 December 2013. doi:10.1038/leu.2013.378.",

        "abstract": "The accessibility of extravascular tumor tissue to drugs is critical for therapeutic efficacy. We previously described a tumor-targeting peptide (iRGD) that elicits active transport of drugs and macromolecules (covalently coupled or co-administered) across the vascular wall into tumor tissue. Short peptides (iRGD is a 9-amino acid cyclic peptide) generally have a plasma half-life measured in minutes. Since short half-life limits the window of activity obtained with a bolus injection of iRGD, we explored to extend the half-life of the peptide. We show here that addition of a cysteine residue prolongs the plasma half-life of iRGD and increases the accumulation of the peptide in tumors. This modification prolongs the activity of iRGD in inducing macromolecular extravasation and leads to greater drug accumulation in tumors than is obtained with the unmodified peptide. This effect is mediated by covalent binding of iRGD to plasma albumin through a disulfide bond. Our study provides a simple strategy to improve peptide pharmacokinetics and activity. Applied to RGD, it provides a means to increase the entry of therapeutic agents into tumors.",

        "abstract": "Disease relapse remains a major factor limiting the survival of cancer patients. In the plasma cell malignancy multiple myeloma (MM), virtually all patients ultimately succumb to disease relapse and progression despite new therapies that have improved remission rates. Tumor regrowth indicates that clonogenic growth potential is continually maintained, but the determinants of self-renewal in MM are not well understood. Normal stem cells are regulated by extrinsic niche factors, and the tumor microenvironment (TME) may similarly influence tumor cell clonogenic growth and self-renewal. Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) is aberrantly secreted by bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) in MM. We found that GDF15 is produced by BMSCs following direct contact with plasma cells and enhances the tumor initiating potential and self-renewal of MM cells in an AKT and SOX2 dependent manner. Moreover, GDF15 induces the expansion of MM tumor initiating cells (TICs), and changes in the serum levels of GDF15 were associated with changes in the frequency of clonogenic MM cells and the progression-free survival of MM patients. These findings demonstrate that GDF15 plays a critical role in mediating the interaction between mature tumor cells, the TME, and TICs, and strategies targeting GDF15 may impact long-term clinical outcomes in MM.",

We defined the mutational landscape of AITL across 219 genes in 85 cases from the US and Europe. We identified 2 or more mutations in 34 genes, nearly all of which were not previously implicated in AITL. These included loss-of-function mutations in TP53 (n=4), ETV6 (n=3), CCND3 (n=2), and EP300 (n=5) as well as gain-of-function mutations in JAK2 (n=2) and STAT3 (n=4). TET2 was mutated in 65 (76%) AITLs, including 43 that harbored 2 or 3 TET2 mutations. DNMT3A mutations occurred in 28 (33%) AITLs; 100% of these also harbored TET2 mutations (p<0.0001). Seventeen AITLs harbored IDH2 R172 substitutions, including 15 with TET2 mutations. In summary, AITL is characterized by high frequencies of overlapping mutations in epigenetic modifiers and targetable mutations in a subset of cases.",

Diarrhea presented early, with few (8%) patients experiencing grade 3/4 events; dose reduction due to diarrhea occurred in 6% of affected patients. Grade 3/4 myelosuppression TEAEs were reported in 41% of patients; among affected patients, 46% and 32% were managed with bosutinib interruption and dose reduction, respectively. Alanine aminotransferase elevation TEAEs occurred in 17% of patients, including 7% with grade 3/4 events; among patients managed with dose interruption, bosutinib rechallenge was successful in 74%. Overall, bosutinib demonstrated acceptable safety with manageable toxicities as treatment for Ph+ leukemia. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT00261846.",

        "abstract": "Malignant mesothelioma, a very aggressive tumor associated to asbestos exposure, is expected to increase in incidence, and unfortunately, no curative modality exists. Reactivation of p53 is a new attractive antitumoral strategy. p53 is rarely mutated in mesothelioma, but it is inactivated in most tumors by the lack of p14(ARF). Here, we evaluated the feasibility of this approach in pleural mesothelioma by testing RITA and nutlin-3, 2 molecules able to restore p53 function through a different mechanism, on a panel of mesothelioma cell lines representing the epithelioid (NCI-H28, NCI-H2452, IST-MES2), biphasic (MSTO-211H), and sarcomatoid (NCI-H2052) histotypes compared with the normal mesothelial HMC-hTERT. RITA triggered robust caspase-dependent apoptosis specifically in epithelioid and biphasic mesothelioma cell lines, both through wild-type and mutant p53, concomitant to p21 downregulation. Conversely, nutlin-3 induced a p21-dependent growth arrest, rather than apoptosis, and was slightly toxic on HMC-hTERT.   Interestingly, we identified a previously undetected point mutation of p53 (p.Arg249Ser) in IST-MES2, and showed that RITA is also able to reactivate this p53 mutant protein and its apoptotic function. RITA reduced tumor growth in a MSTO-211H-derived xenograft model of mesothelioma and synergized with cisplatin, which is the mainstay of treatment for this tumor. Our data indicate that reactivation of p53 and concomitant p21 downregulation effectively induce cell death in mesothelioma, a tumor characterized by a high intrinsic resistance to apoptosis. Altogether, our findings provide the preclinical framework supporting the use of p53-reactivating agents alone, or in combination regimens, to improve the outcome of patients with mesothelioma.",

Here we show that exosomes, endogenous nano-sized membrane vesicles secreted by most cell types, can deliver chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin (Dox) to tumor tissue in BALB/c nude mice. To reduce immunogenicity and toxicity, mouse immature dendritic cells (imDCs) were used for exosome production. Tumor targeting was facilitated by engineering the imDCs to express a well-characterized exosomal membrane protein (Lamp2b) fused to αv integrin-specific iRGD peptide (CRGDKGPDC). Purified exosomes from imDCs were loaded with Dox via electroporation, with an encapsulation efficiency of up to 20%. iRGD exosomes showed highly efficient targeting and Dox delivery to αv integrin-positive breast cancer cells in vitro as demonstrated by confocal imaging and flow cytometry. Intravenously injected targeted exosomes delivered Dox specifically to tumor tissues, leading to inhibition of tumor growth without overt toxicity. Our results suggest that exosomes modified by targeting ligands can be used therapeutically for the delivery of Dox to tumors, thus having great potential value for clinical applications.",

LSD test shows that there was a statistical significance between each of the two subgroups except stage II in CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Tregs and control vs. each stage, stage I vs. stage III, and stage IV in CD8+CD28- Tregs. There is no significant difference among stages II, III, and IV in CD8+CD28- Tregs. No differences were found between squamous carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. These levels were dropped significantly after operation. Furthermore postoperative Treg percentage in the early stages (stage I and stage II) was not statistically different from that of controls. Postoperative Treg percentage in advanced stage (III+IV) remained above the values shown by controls. Our findings indicate that the percentage of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ and CD8+CD28- Tregs correlated with the pathological stage in NSCLC and tumor burden.",

        "abstract": "Keratoacanthomas (KAs) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cuSCCs) develop in 15-30% of patients with BRAF(V600E) metastatic melanoma treated with BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi). These lesions resemble mouse skin tumors induced by the two-stage DMBA/TPA skin carcinogenesis protocol; in this protocol BRAFi accelerates tumor induction. Since prior studies demonstrated cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) is necessary for DMBA/TPA tumor induction, we hypothesized that COX-2 inhibition might prevent BRAFi-accelerated skin tumors. Celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, significantly delayed tumor acceleration by the BRAFi inhibitor PLX7420 and decreased tumor number by 90%. Tumor gene expression profiling demonstrated that celecoxib partially reversed the PLX4720-induced gene signature. In PDV cuSCC cells, vemurafenib (a clinically approved BRAFi) increased ERK phosphorylation and soft agar colony formation; both responses were greatly decreased by celecoxib. In clinical trials trametinib, a MEK inhibitor (MEKi) increases BRAFi therapy efficacy in BRAF(V600E) melanomas and reduces BRAFi-induced KA and cuSCC frequency. Trametinib also reduced vemurafenib-induced PDV soft agar colonies, but less efficiently than celecoxib. The trametinb/celecoxib combination was more effective than either inhibitor alone. In conclusion, celecoxib suppressed both BRAFi-accelerated skin tumors and soft-agar colonies, warranting its testing as a chemopreventive agent for non-melanoma skin lesions in patients treated with BRAFi alone or in combination with MEKi.",

        "abstract": "Neuronatin is a unique, ubiquitous and highly conserved mammalian gene involved in brain development. Its mRNA isoforms, chromosomal location, genomic DNA structure and regulation have been characterized. More recently there has been rapid progress in the understanding of its function in physiology and human disease. In particular there is fairly direct evidence implicating neuronatin in the causation of Lafora disease and diabetes. Neuronatin protein has a strong predisposition to misfold and form cellular aggregates that causes cell death by apoptosis. Aggregation of Neuronatin within cortical neurons and resulting cell death is the hallmark of Lafora disease, a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease. Under high glucose conditions simulating diabetes, neuronatin protein also accumulates and destroys pancreatic beta cells. The neuronatin gene is imprinted and only the paternal allele is normally expressed in the adult. However, changes in DNA methylation may cause the maternal allele to lose imprinting and trigger cell proliferation and metastasis. Neuronatin has also been shown to be translated peripherally within the dendrites of neurons, a finding of relevance in synaptic plasticity. The current understanding of the function of neuronatin raises the possibility that this gene may participate in the common downstream mechanisms associated with aberrant neuronal growth and death. A better understanding of these mechanisms may open new therapeutic targets to help modify the progression of devastating neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and anterior horn cell disease.",

        "abstract": "Drugs belonging to the Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) group are not only used as anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anti-pyretic agents, but also show anti-cancer effects. Complexing them with a bioactive metal like copper, show an enhancement in their anti-cancer effects compared to the bare drugs, whose exact mechanism of action is not yet fully understood. For the first time, it was shown by our group that Cu(II)-NSAIDs can directly bind to the DNA backbone. The ability of the copper complexes of NSAIDs namely meloxicam and piroxicam to bind to the DNA backbone could be a possible molecular mechanism behind their enhanced anticancer effects. Elucidating base sequence specific interaction of Cu(II)-NSAIDs to the DNA will provide information on their possible binding sites in the genome sequence. In this work, we present how these complexes respond to differences in structure and hydration pattern of GC rich sequences. For this, binding studies of Cu(II) complexes of piroxicam [Cu(II)-(Px)2 (L)2] and meloxicam [Cu(II)-(Mx)2 (L)] with alternating GC (polydG-dC) and homopolymeric GC (polydG-polydC) sequences were carried out using a combination of spectroscopic techniques that include UV-Vis absorption, fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The Cu(II)-NSAIDs show strong binding affinity to both polydG-dC and polydG-polydC. The role reversal of Cu(II)-meloxicam from a strong binder of polydG-dC (Kb=11.5×10(3)M(-1)) to a weak binder of polydG-polydC (Kb=5.02×10(3)M(-1)), while Cu(II)-piroxicam changes from a strong binder of polydG-polydC (Kb=8.18×10(3)M(-1)) to a weak one of polydG-dC (Kb=2.18×10(3)M(-1)), point to the sensitivity of these complexes to changes in the backbone structures/hydration. Changes in the profiles of UV absorption band and CD difference spectra, upon complex binding to polynucleotides and the results of competitive binding assay using ethidium bromide (EtBr) fluorescence indicate different binding modes in each case.",

WC and WHR are highly heritable with multiple susceptibility loci identified to date. We assessed the association between SNPs and BMI-adjusted WC and WHR and unadjusted WC in up to 57,412 individuals of European descent from 22 cohorts collaborating with the NHLBI's Candidate Gene Association Resource (CARe) project. The study population consisted of women and men aged 20 to 80. Study participants were genotyped using the ITMAT/Broad/CARE array, which includes ∼50,000 cosmopolitan tagged SNPs across ∼2,100 cardiovascular-related genes. Each trait was modeled as a function of age, study site, and principal components to control for population stratification, and we conducted a fixed-effects meta-analysis. No new loci for WC were observed. For WHR analyses, three novel loci were significantly associated (P<2.4x10(-6)). Previously unreported rs2811337-G near TMCC1 was associated with increased WHR (β±SE,0.048±0.008, P=7.7x10(-9)) as was rs7302703-G in HOXC10 (β=0.044±0.008, P=2.9x10(-7)) and rs936108-C in PEMT (β=0.035±0.007, P=1.9x10(-6)). Sex-stratified analyses revealed two additional novel signals among females only, rs12076073-A near SHC1 (β=0.10±0.02, P=1.9x10(-6)), and rs1037575-A in ATBDB4 (β=0.046±0.01, P=2.2x10(-6)), supporting an already established sexual dimorphism of central adiposity-related genetic variants.

        "abstract": "Hypoxia is known to influence the cell cycle by increasing the G1 phase duration or by inducing a quiescent state (arrest of cell proliferation). This entry into quiescence is a mean for the cell to escape from hypoxia-induced apoptosis. It is suggested that some cancer cells have gain the advantage over normal cells to easily enter into quiescence when environmental conditions, such as oxygen pressure, are unfavorable ([43,1]). This ability contributes in the appearance of highly resistant and aggressive tumor phenotypes ([2]). The HiF-1α factor is the key actor of the intracellular hypoxia pathway. As tumor cells undergo chronic hypoxic conditions, HiF-1α is present in higher level in cancer than in normal cells. Besides, it was shown that genetic mutations promoting overstabilization of HiF-1α are a feature of various types of cancers ([7]). Finally, it is suggested that the intracellular level of HiF-1α can be related to the aggressiveness of the tumors ([53,24,4,10]). However, up to now, mathematical models describing the G1/S transition under hypoxia, did not take into account the HiF-1α factor in the hypoxia pathway. Therefore, we propose a mathematical model of the G1/S transition under hypoxia, which explicitly integrates the HiF-1α pathway. The model reproduces the slowing down of G1 phase under moderate hypoxia, and the entry into quiescence of proliferating cells under severe hypoxia. We show how the inhibition of cyclin D by HiF-1α can induce quiescence; this result provides a theoretical explanation to the experimental observations of Wen et al. (2010). Thus, our model confirms that hypoxia-induced chemoresistance can be linked, for a part, to the negative regulation of cyclin D by HiF-1α.",

        "abstract": "Since response to platinum-based therapy in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is poor, the present study was designed to rationally identify novel drug combinations in cell models including the A549 cell line and the cisplatin-resistant subline A549/Pt, characterized by reduced sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis and by up-regulation of efflux transporters of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. Given the molecular features of these cells, we focused on compounds triggering apoptosis through different mechanisms, such as the mitochondria-targeting drug arsenic trioxide and the phenanthridine analog sanguinarine, which induce apoptosis through the extrinsic pathway. Sanguinarine, not recognized by ABC transporters, could overcome cisplatin resistance and, when used in combination with arsenic trioxide, was synergistic in A549 and A549/Pt cells. The arsenic trioxide/sanguinarine co-treatment up-regulated genes implicated in apoptosis activation through the extrinsic pathway. Drug combination experiments indicated that TRAIL treatment improved arsenic trioxide/sanguinarine efficacy, a feature associated with a striking apoptosis induction, particularly in the cisplatin-resistant variant. Thus, a synergistic interaction between sanguinarine and arsenic trioxide could be obtained independently of relative cell sensitivity to arsenic trioxide, and an enhanced apoptosis induction could be achieved in combination with TRAIL through modulation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Antitumor activity studies supported the interest of drug combinations including TRAIL in NSCLC, indicating that drug-resistant NSCLC cells can efficiently be killed by the combination of pro-apoptotic agents. Our results suggest that the molecular changes occurring in treated cells may be exploited to rationally hit surviving cells.",

Median age of all patients was 48 years (range 18-71). Based on age and remission status, patients were divided into 4 groups: CR1 age <60 years (n=116); CR2 age <60 years (n=78), CR1 age ≥60 years (n=32) and CR2 age ≥60 years (n=16). Donors were matched related (n=155, 64%) or matched unrelated (n=87, 36%). Median follow up of survivors was 65 months (range 12-145). In a univariate analysis, 3-year OS of the four groups as defined above was 57%, 43%, 39% and 16% (p=0.003), respectively. In a multivariable analysis, hazard ratios of non-relapse mortality and survival were 2.08 (p=0.06) and 1.52 (p=0.23) in patients ≥60 years in CR2 compared to ≥60 years in CR1. While a plateau in survival was observed for patients ≥60 years in CR1 similar to those <60 years in CR1 and CR2, no long term survivors were seen in patients ≥60 years in CR2. Our data suggest disappointing outcome of AML patients ≥60 years of age transplanted in CR2. Therefore, if a transplant is indicated, early referral is recommended in patients ≥60 years with AML.",

        "abstract": "miR-30d has been observed to be significantly down-regulated in human anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), and is believed to be an important event in thyroid cell transformation. In this study, we found that miR-30d has a critical role in modulating sensitivity of ATC cells to cisplatin, a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug for treatment of this neoplasm. Using a mimic of miR-30d, we demonstrated that miR-30d could negatively regulate the expression of beclin 1, a key autophagy gene, leading to suppression of the cisplatin-activated autophagic response that protects ATC cells from apoptosis. A reporter gene assay demonstrated that the binding sequences of miR-30d in the beclin 1-3' UTR was the region required for the inhibition of beclin 1 expression by this miRNA. We further showed that inhibition of the beclin 1-mediated autophagy by the miR-30d mimic sensitized ATC cells to cisplatin both in vitro (cell culture) and in vivo (animal xenograft model). These results suggest that dysregulation of miR-30d in ATC cells is responsible for the insensitivity to cisplatin by promoting autophagic survival. Thus, miR-30d may be exploited as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of ATC.",

        "abstract": "Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a heterodimeric transcription factor that mediates the adaptation of tumor cells and tissues to the hypoxic microenvironment, has attracted considerable interest as a potential therapeutic target. Recently, HIF-1α has been recognized as the critical target of cardiac glycosides for cancer therapy, but the molecular mechanism of cardiac glycosides' inhibition of HIF-1α is still poorly understood. In the present study, we observed that neither HIF-1α mRNA levels nor HIF-1α protein degradation are affected by Ouabain. However, Ouabain was found to be associated with the regulation of HIF-1α translation. Basing on in silico, in vitro and ex vivo models of translation processing, further studies revealed that eIF4E plays a critical role in the inhibitory effect of Ouabain on HIF-1α protein synthesis, rather than mTORC1, eIF2α signaling or Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase inhibition. Mechanistically, Ouabain directly binds eIF4E, disrupts eIF4E/eIF4G association (200μM, Inhibit rate =61±3%) but not the eIF4E/mRNA complex formation (200μM, Inhibit rate =18±5%) both in vitro and in cells, thereby inhibiting the intracellular cap-dependent translation. The association between Ouabain and eIF4E not only raises the hope of using cardiac glycosides for cancer therapeutics more rational, but also offers a pharmacologic means for developing novel anti-cancer HIF-1α antagonists.",

        "abstract": "Background. Secondary angiosarcoma is a malignant cancer that develops in approximately 1% of patients treated with breast-conserving therapy (BCT) for primary breast cancer. Most treatments for secondary angiosarcoma have been unsuccessful and no consensus has been reached on what is the best therapeutic strategy. We report long-term outcomes of patients with secondary angiosarcoma treated with hyperfractionated and accelerated re-irradiation (HART). Material and methods. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of, and established direct contact with, 14 consecutive patients with secondary angiosarcoma after BCT with axillary lymph node dissection who were treated at our institution with HART with or without surgery from November 1997 to March 2006. With HART, patients received three radiation therapy treatments each day, with a minimum interfraction interval of four hours, five days a week, at 1 Gy per fraction, to total doses of 45 Gy, 60 Gy, and 75 Gy for areas with a moderate risk for subclinical disease, a high risk for subclinical disease, and gross disease, respectively. The minimum follow-up for these patients was six years. Results. Median survival was 7.0 years (range 0.4-14.7 years), with five- and 10-year overall survival rates of 79% [95% confidence interval (CI), 51-93%] and 63% (95% CI 37-84%), respectively, and five- and 10-year cause-specific survival rates of 79% (95% CI 51-93%) and 71% (95% CI 44-89%), respectively. Toxicity was minimal. Conclusion. Our long-term study provides evidence that patients with secondary angiosarcoma after BCT can frequently be cured. Patients treated with HART have higher overall survival, progression-free survival, and cause-specific survival rates than patients who receive only surgery, conventional radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. HART is well tolerated.",

        "abstract": "Purpose. To investigate long-term development of sickness absence and disability pension among colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors compared to matched cancer-free controls, and to assess to what degree socio-demographic and disease characteristics influence these outcomes. Patients and methods. In a register-based cohort study with data from the Cancer Registry of Norway and longitudinal data from other national registries, 740 patients with CRC diagnosed 1992-1996 at the age 45-54 years were observed up to 14 years post-diagnosis. Also 740 matched controls were observed over the same time period. Results. During the first year after diagnosis, 85% of the CRC survivors were on sick-leave at some point, compared to 19% of the controls. Among survivors with localized cancer, 21% were on sick-leave 12 months after diagnosis, versus 33% with regional, and 52% with distant cancer. Survivors with rectum cancer were more likely than colon cancer survivors to be on sick-leave the first year after diagnosis (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.61-3.98). CRC survivors were at higher risk for disability pension (DP) than controls, depending on extent of disease. Hazard ratios for DP were 1.67 (95% CI 1.13-2.46) for survivors with localized cancer, 3.12 (95% CI 2.06-4.72) for regional, and 10.13 (95% CI 4.17-24.62) for distant cancer, respectively. In survivors, distant cancer, low level of education, not having children < 18 years in the household, pre-diagnostic sick-leave and not being employed at diagnosis were associated with increased likelihood for DP. Conclusion. A considerable proportion of CRC survivors, for years after diagnosis, will experience reduced work ability compared to controls. Rehabilitation and workplace adjustment to reduce sickness absence and improve work ability should be a long-term concern.",

We investigated 49 PXAs for clinical, histological and immunohistochemical characteristics related to BRAF mutation status. BRAF mutation was detected by immunohistochemistry/sequencing in 38/49 (78%) tumors. All but one PXA from temporal location harbored a BRAF V600E mutation (23/24; 96%) compared to 10/19 (53%) non-temporal PXAs (p=0.0009). Histological and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated increased reticulin deposition (76% vs. 27%; p=0.003) and a more frequent expression of CD34 in BRAF mutant PXAs (76% vs. 27%; p=0.003). We further investigated the utility of combined BRAF V600E (VE1) and p16 analysis by immunohistochemisty to delineate PXAs from relevant histological mimics like giant cell glioblastoma. In PXAs 38/49 (78%) were VE1 positive, and 30/49 (61%) had a loss of p16 expression. The combined features (VE1+ / p16 loss) were observed in 25/49 (51%) PXAs but were not observed in giant cell glioblastoma (VE1 0/28, p16 loss 14/28). Together, we demonstrate that temporal location, reticulin deposition and CD34 expression are associated with BRAF mutation in PXA. Combined VE1 positivity and p16 loss represent a frequent immunoprofile of PXA and may therefore constitute an additional diagnostic tool for its differential diagnostics.",

Two compounds are highly potent on cancer cells in the submicromolar range without any toxicity on healthy cells. A more detailed analysis of the cellular effect of these PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitors demonstrated that they induce G1-phase cell cycle arrest in breast cancer cells and trigger apoptosis.

        "abstract": "Aberrant expression of a zinc transporter ZIP4 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has been shown to contribute to tumor progression and is a potential target for individualized therapy. The overall objective of this study was to determine whether ZIP4 could serve as a novel diagnostic and prognostic marker in human PDAC, and if it can be assessed by minimally invasive sampling using endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). Immunohistochemistry was performed to compare ZIP4 expression in the PDAC samples obtained from EUS-FNA and matched surgical tumors (parallel control). Samples were reported by sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values, all with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A total of 23 cases with both FNA and surgical specimens were evaluated. We found that ZIP4 was significantly over-expressed in tumor cells from both sets of samples. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ZIP4 for the diagnosis of PDAC were 72.9%, 72.5%, 76.1%, and 69.0% in EUS-FNA samples, and were 97.9%, 65.4%, 83.9%, and 94.4% in surgical specimens, respectively. The association between the positive rate of ZIP4 expression in FNA and surgical samples is statistically significant (P=0.0216). Both the intensity and percentage of ZIP4 positive cells from the surgical samples correlated significantly with tumor stage (P=0.0025 and P=0.0002). ZIP4 intensity level in FNA samples was significantly associated with tumor differentiation and patient survival. These results indicate that EUS-FNA is capable of non-operative detection of ZIP4, thus offering the potential to direct pre-operative detection and targeted therapy of PDAC.",

This study incorporates the comprehensive model of information seeking and two competing models of social enhancement and social compensation, as well as the literature on lurking and posting behaviors in online groups to answer research questions. Our findings suggest that patterns of engagement in a CMSS group differed according to patients' sociodemographic characteristics and psychosocial factors. In addition, we found that lurkers had a higher level of perceived functional well-being than posters at 3 months post baseline. Theoretical and practical implications for effective online cancer support group campaigns are discussed.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this review is to address the recent advances regarding the use of pharmacological agents to target the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels in cancer and their potential application in therapeutics. Physiologically, TRP channels are responsible for cation entry (Ca(2+) , Na(+) , Mg(2+) ) in many mammalian cells and regulate a large number of cellular functions. However, dysfunction in channel expression and/or activity can be linked to human diseases like cancer. Indeed, there is growing evidence that TRP channels expression is altered in cancer tissues in comparison to the normal ones. Moreover, these proteins are involved in many cancerous processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion as well as resistance to chemotherapy. Among the TRP superfamily, TRPC, TRPV, TRPM and TRPA1 have been shown to play a role in many cancer types including breast, digestive, gliomas, head and neck, lung, and prostate cancers. Pharmacological modulators are used to characterize the functional implications of TRP channels in whole-cell membrane currents, resting membrane potential regulation and intracellular Ca(2+) signaling. Moreover, pharmacological modulation of TRP activity in cancer cells is systematically linked to the effect on cancerous processes (proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs). Here we describe the effects of such TRP modulators on TRP activity and cancer cell phenotype. Furthermore, the potency and specificity of these agents will be discussed as well as the development of new strategies targeting TRP channels in cancer.",

Fecal calprotectin might also be useful to monitor patients with IBD under treatment and to predict the risk of recurrence of active disease prior to clinical relapse. The use of fecal calprotectin has been investigated in a number of gastrointestinal disorders other than IBD, for example, as screening test for colorectal cancer but the available data are limited.

However, few studies have looked beyond the physiological impairment to explore the lived experience of dysphagia in the post-treatment period of HNC. The current study adopted a person-centred, qualitative approach to describe the experiences of people living with dysphagia in the months and years following non-surgical treatment for HNC. Using maximum variation sampling, 24 participants who had undergone radiotherapy treatment for HNC were recruited. Individual interviews were conducted to explore the impact of dysphagia on participants' everyday lives. The themes identified included: (1) physical changes related to swallowing; (2) emotions evoked by living with dysphagia; (3) altered perceptions and changes in appreciation of food; and (4) personal and lifestyle impacts. The data revealed the breadth and significance of the impact of dysphagia on the lives of people treated curatively for HNC. Assessment and management in the post-treatment period must be sufficiently holistic to address both the changing physical states and the psychosocial needs of people with dysphagia following HNC. Rehabilitation services which focus only on impairment-based management will fail to fully meet the support needs of this clinical population.",

The polymer-nucleic acid nanoparticles have a core-shell architecture with dense PEG brush coating. We characterized these nanoparticles using ITC, DLS, FRET, FCS, TIRF, and TEM. In addition to small size, these nanoparticles have neutral zeta-potentials, making the presented polymer architecture a very attractive platform for investigation of yet poorly studied polyplex size range for siRNA and antisense oligonucleotide delivery applications.",

Due to their multifunctional properties, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) have received great attention of scientists to find a solution to cancer. Vitamin supplements may contribute to a reduction in the risk of cancer. Vitamin B12 has several characteristics that make it an attractive entity for cancer treatment and possible therapeutic applications. The aim of this study was to produce B12-loaded SLNs (B12-SLNs) and determine the cytotoxic effects of B12-SLNs on H-Ras 5RP7 and NIH/3T3 control cell line. Results obtained by MTT assay, transmission electron and confocal microscopy showed that B12-loaded SLNs are more effective than free vitamin B12 on cancer cells. In addition, characterization studies indicate that while the average diameter of the B12 was about 650 nm, B12-SLNs were about 200 nm and the drug release efficiency of vit. B12 by means of SLNs increased up to 3 h. These observations point to the fact that B12-SLNs could be used as carrier systems due to the therapeutic effects on cancer.",

However, psychological theorizing suggests that, when methods do not challenge subjects to consider other uses of resources, curative treatment is favored over prevention. Could it be that while prevention is praised, cure is preferred?",

In this study, we analysed the 8 key mutations in 442 serum samples collected from 310 non-HCC and 132 HCC patients to identify the combinations linked to HCC. After the patients were stratified according to the age groups and mutation combinations, clinical parameters were compared between the HCC and the non-HCC groups. Analyses were focused on patient ≥40 years of age infected by HBV genotype C with A1762T and G1764A mutations in the basal core promoter region (BCP double mutation). In patients with ≥6 mutations, the combination of [G1613A + C1653T + A1846T + G1896A] mutations was closely linked to HCC, whereas no specific single or double mutation combination was associated with HCC. In patients with ≤5 mutations, HBeAg and HBV DNA serum titres were lower in the HCC group than those in the non-HCC group. Unlike the number of mutations, no specific combination correlated with advanced clinical stage in HCC. Of the BCP double mutation-based HBV mutant types, combinations of ≥6 mutations that include G1613A + C1653T + A1846T + G1896A, and combinations of ≤5 mutations with reduced HBeAg production, may be more specific indicators of HCC risk than only the number of mutations or any specific combination(s).",

        "abstract": "Affibody molecules are a class of affinity agents for molecular imaging based on a non-immunoglobulin protein scaffold. Previous studies have demonstrated high contrast for in vivo imaging of cancer-associated molecular abnormalities using Affibody molecules. Using the radionuclide (18)F for labeling and PET as the imaging modality, the sensitivity of molecular imaging using Affibody molecules can be further increased. The use of oxime formation between an aminooxy-functionalized peptide and (18)F-fluorobenzaldehyde ((18)F-FBA) is a promising way of radiolabeling targeting peptides. However, previous studies demonstrated that application of this method to Affibody molecules is associated with high liver uptake. We hypothesized that incorporation of a triglutamyl spacer between the aminooxy moiety and the N-terminus of a synthetic Affibody molecule would decrease the hepatic uptake of the (18)F-N-(4-fluorobenzylidine)oxime)((18)F-FBO)-labeled tracer. To verify this, we have produced two variants of the HER2-targeting ZHER2:342 Affibody molecule by peptide synthesis: OA-PEP4313, where aminooxyacetic acid was conjugated directly to the N-terminal alanine, and OA-E3-PEP4313, where a triglutamyl spacer was introduced between the aminooxy moiety and the N-terminus. We have found that the use of the spacer is associated with a minor decrease of affinity, from KD = 49 pM to KD = 180 pM. Radiolabeled (18)F-FBO-E3-PEP4313 demonstrated specific binding to HER2-expressing ovarian carcinoma SKOV-3 cells and slow internalization. Biodistribution studies in mice demonstrated that the use of a triglutamyl linker decreased uptake of radioactivity in liver 2.7-fold at 2 h after injection. Interestingly, radioactivity uptake in kidneys was also reduced (2.4-fold). Experiments in BALB/C nu/nu mice bearing SKOV-3 demonstrated HER2-specific uptake of (18)F-FBO-E3-PEP4313 in tumors. At 2 h pi, the tumor uptake (20 ± 2 % ID/g) exceeded uptake in liver 5-fold and uptake in kidneys 3.6-fold. The tumor-to-blood ratio was 21±3. The microPET/CT imaging experiment confirmed the biodistribution data. In conclusion, the use of a triglutamyl spacer is a convenient way to improve the biodistribution profile of Affibody molecules labeled at the N-terminus using (18)F-FBA. It provides at tracer capable of producing high-contrast images of HER2-expressing tumors.",

        "abstract": "Basement membrane, a specialized ECM that underlies polarized epithelium of eumetazoans, provides signaling cues that regulate cell behavior and function in tissue genesis and homeostasis. A collagen IV scaffold, a major component, is essential for tissues and dysfunctional in several diseases. Studies of bovine and Drosophila tissues reveal that the scaffold is stabilized by sulfilimine chemical bonds (S = N) that covalently cross-link methionine and hydroxylysine residues at the interface of adjoining triple helical protomers. Peroxidasin, a heme peroxidase embedded in the basement membrane, produces hypohalous acid intermediates that oxidize methionine, forming the sulfilimine cross-link. We explored whether the sulfilimine cross-link is a fundamental requirement in the genesis and evolution of epithelial tissues by determining its occurrence and evolutionary origin in Eumetazoa and its essentiality in zebrafish development; 31 species, spanning 11 major phyla, were investigated for the occurrence of the sulfilimine cross-link by electrophoresis, MS, and multiple sequence alignment of de novo transcriptome and available genomic data for collagen IV and peroxidasin. The results show that the cross-link is conserved throughout Eumetazoa and arose at the divergence of Porifera and Cnidaria over 500 Mya. Also, peroxidasin, the enzyme that forms the bond, is evolutionarily conserved throughout Metazoa. Morpholino knockdown of peroxidasin in zebrafish revealed that the cross-link is essential for organogenesis. Collectively, our findings establish that the triad-a collagen IV scaffold with sulfilimine cross-links, peroxidasin, and hypohalous acids-is a primordial innovation of the ECM essential for organogenesis and tissue evolution.",

        "abstract": "JMJD5, a Jumonji C domain-containing dioxygenase, is important for embryonic development and cancer growth. Here, we show that JMJD5 is up-regulated by hypoxia and is crucial for hypoxia-induced cell proliferation. JMJD5 interacts directly with pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme (PKM)2 to modulate metabolic flux in cancer cells. The JMJD5-PKM2 interaction resides at the intersubunit interface region of PKM2, which hinders PKM2 tetramerization and blocks pyruvate kinase activity. This interaction also influences translocation of PKM2 into the nucleus and promotes hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α-mediated transactivation. JMJD5 knockdown inhibits the transcription of the PKM2-HIF-1α target genes involved in glucose metabolism, resulting in a reduction of glucose uptake and lactate secretion in cancer cells. JMJD5, along with PKM2 and HIF-1α, is recruited to the hypoxia response element site in the lactate dehydrogenase A and PKM2 loci and mediates the recruitment of the latter two proteins. Our data uncover a mechanism whereby PKM2 can be regulated by factor-binding-induced homo/heterooligomeric restructuring, paving the way to cell metabolic reprogram.",

        "abstract": "Cancer-prone syndrome of premature chromatid separation with mosaic variegated aneuploidy [PCS (MVA) syndrome] is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by constitutional aneuploidy and a high risk of childhood cancer. We previously reported monoallelic mutations in the BUB1B gene (encoding BUBR1) in seven Japanese families with the syndrome. No second mutation was found in the opposite allele of any of the families studied, although a conserved BUB1B haplotype and a decreased transcript were identified. To clarify the molecular pathology of the second allele, we extended our mutational search to a candidate region surrounding BUB1B. A unique single nucleotide substitution, G > A at ss802470619, was identified in an intergenic region 44 kb upstream of a BUB1B transcription start site, which cosegregated with the disorder. To examine whether this is the causal mutation, we designed a transcription activator-like effector nuclease-mediated two-step single-base pair editing strategy and biallelically introduced this substitution into cultured human cells. The cell clones showed reduced BUB1B transcripts, increased PCS frequency, and MVA, which are the hallmarks of the syndrome. We also encountered a case of a Japanese infant with PCS (MVA) syndrome carrying a homozygous single nucleotide substitution at ss802470619. These results suggested that the nucleotide substitution identified was the causal mutation of PCS (MVA) syndrome.",

However, detection of such epitopes is hampered by self-tolerance and limitations in the sensitivity of mass spectrometry. Here, we used T cells from HLA-A2-negative donors as tools to detect HLA-A2-bound peptides from two leukemia-associated differentiation antigens; CD20 and the previously undescribed cancer target myeloperoxidase. A high-throughput platform for epitope discovery was designed using dendritic cells cotransfected with full-length transcripts of self-TAA and HLA-A2 to allow presentation of all naturally processed peptides from a predefined self-protein on foreign HLA. Antigen-reactive T cells were directly detected using panels of color-coded peptide-HLA multimers containing epitopes predicted by a computer algorithm. Strikingly, cytotoxic T cells were generated against 37 out of 50 peptides predicted to bind HLA-A2. Among these, 36 epitopes were previously undescribed. The allorestricted T cells were exquisitely peptide- and HLA-specific and responded strongly to HLA-A2-positive leukemic cells with endogenous expression of CD20 or myeloperoxidase. These results indicate that the repertoire of self-peptides presented on HLA class I has been underestimated and that a wealth of self-TAA can be targeted by T cells when using nontolerized T-cell repertoires.",

How plexin regulation of neurite outgrowth, lymphoid trafficking, and vascular endothelial cell branching is linked to integrin function, central to most directed movement, remains unclear. Here we show that on developing thymocytes, plexinD1 controls surface topology of nanometer-scaled β1 integrin adhesion domains in cis, whereas its ligation by sema3E in trans regulates individual β1 integrin catch bonds. Loss of plexinD1 expression reduces β1 integrin clustering, thereby diminishing avidity, whereas sema3E ligation shortens individual integrin bond lifetimes under force to reduce stability. Consequently, both decreased expression of plexinD1 during developmental progression and a thymic medulla-emanating sema3E gradient enhance thymocyte movement toward the medulla, thus enforcing the orchestrated lymphoid trafficking required for effective immune repertoire selection. Our results demonstrate plexin-tunable molecular features of integrin adhesion with broad implications for many cellular processes.",

        "abstract": "The Hedgehog pathway has been implicated in the tumorigenesis, tumor progression and metastasis of numerous human cancers. We generated the first fully human hedgehog antibody MEDI-5304 and characterized its antitumor activity and preclinical toxicology. MEDI-5304 bound Sonic and Indian hedgehog with low picomolar affinity and neutralized SHH and IHH activity in cellular mGLI1 reporter assays. The antibody inhibited transcription of hedgehog target genes and osteoblast differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells. We evaluated the activity of MEDI-5304 in vivo in model systems that allowed us to evaluate two primary hypotheses of hedgehog function in human cancer, paracrine signaling between tumor and stromal cells and cancer stem cell (CSC) self-renewal. MEDI-5304 displayed robust pharmacodynamic effects in stromal cells that translated to antitumor efficacy as a single agent in an HT-29/MEF co-implantation model of paracrine hedgehog signaling. MEDI-5304 also improved responses to carboplatin in the HT-29/MEF model. The antibody, however, had no effect as a single agent or in combination with gemcitabine on the cancer stem cell frequency or growth of several primary pancreatic cancer explant models. These findings support the conclusion that hedgehog contributes to tumor biology via paracrine tumor-stromal signaling but not via cancer stem cell maintenance or propagation. Finally, the only safety finding associated with MEDI-5304 was ondontodysplasia in rats. Thus, MEDI-5304 represents a potent dual hedgehog inhibitor suitable for continued development to evaluate efficacy and safety in human patients with tumors harboring elevated levels of Sonic or Indian hedgehog.",

        "abstract": "TOR proteins reside in two distinct complexes, TOR complex 1 and 2 (TORC1 and TORC2) that are central for the regulation of cellular growth, proliferation and survival. TOR is also the target for the immunosuppressive and anti-cancer drug rapamycin. In Schizosaccharaomyces pombe, disruption of the TSC complex, mutations in which can lead to the Tuberous Sclerosis syndrome in humans, results in a rapamycin sensitive phenotype under poor nitrogen conditions. We show here that the sensitivity to rapamycin is mediated via inhibition of TORC1 and suppressed by overexpression of isp7(+), a member of the family of 2-oxoglutarate-Fe(II) dependent oxygenases. The transcript level of isp7(+) is negatively regulated by TORC1 but positively regulated by TORC2. Yet, we find extensive similarity between the transcriptome of cells disrupted for isp7(+) and cells mutated in the catalytic subunit of TORC1. Moreover, Isp7 regulates amino acid permease expression similarly to TORC1 and in contrast to TORC2. Overexpression of isp7(+) induces TORC1-dependent phosphorylation of ribosomal protein Rps6, while inhibiting TORC2-dependent phosphorylation and activation of the AGC-like kinase Gad8. Taken together, our findings suggest a central role for Isp7 in amino acid homeostasis and the presence of isp7(+)-dependent regulatory loops that affect both TORC1 and TORC2.",

        "abstract": "The induction of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) is essential for the adaptation of tumor cells to a low oxygen environment. We found that the expression of the apoptosis inhibitor ARC was induced by hypoxia in a variety of cancer cell types and its induction is primarily HIF1 dependent. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and reporter assays also indicate that the ARC gene is regulated by direct binding of HIF1 to a hypoxia response element (HRE) located at -190 bp upstream of the transcription start site. HIFs play an essential role in the pathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) under normoxic conditions, through the loss of the Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene. Accordingly, our results show that ARC is not expressed in normal renal tissue, but is highly expressed in 65% of RCC tumors, which also express high levels of Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CAIX), a HIF1-dependent gene. Compared to controls, ARC-deficient RCCs exhibited decreased colony formation and increased apoptosis in vitro. In addition, loss of ARC resulted in a dramatic reduction of RCC tumor growth in SCID mice in vivo. Thus, HIF-mediated increased expression of ARC in RCC can explain how loss of VHL can promote survival early in tumor formation.",

Although many studies focus on heterochromatin gain, this work demonstrates large-scale unraveling of peri/centromeric satellites, which occurs in all models of human and mouse senescence examined. This was not seen in cancer cells, except in a benign senescent tumor in vivo. Senescence-associated distension of satellites (SADS) occurs earlier and more consistently than heterochromatin foci formation, and SADS is not exclusive to either the p16 or p21 pathways. Because Hutchinson Guilford progeria syndrome patient cells do not form excess heterochromatin, the question remained whether or not proliferative arrest in this aging syndrome involved distinct epigenetic mechanisms. Here, we show that SADS provides a unifying event in both progeria and normal senescence. Additionally, SADS represents a novel, cytological-scale unfolding of chromatin, which is not concomitant with change to several canonical histone marks nor a result of DNA hypomethylation. Rather, SADS is likely mediated by changes to higher-order nuclear structural proteins, such as LaminB1.",

        "abstract": "Arp2/3-branched actin is critical for cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration. However, perturbations and diseases affecting this network have phenotypes that cannot be fully explained by cell-autonomous effects. In this paper, we report nonautonomous effects of Arp2/3 depletion. We show that, upon Arp2/3 depletion, the expression of numerous genes encoding secreted factors, including chemokines, growth factors, and matrix metalloproteases, was increased, a signature resembling the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. These factors affected epidermal growth factor chemotaxis in a nonautonomous way, resolving the recent contradictions about the role of Arp2/3 in chemotaxis. We demonstrate that these genes were activated by nuclear factor κB via a CCM2-MEKK3 pathway that has been implicated in hyperosmotic stress signaling. Consistent with this, Arp2/3-depleted cells showed misregulation of volume control and reduced actin in the submembranous cortex. The defects in osmotic signaling in the Arp2/3-depleted cells can be rescued by hypoosmotic treatment. Thus, perturbations of Arp2/3 have nonautonomous effects that should be considered when evaluating experimental manipulations and diseases affecting the Arp2/3-actin cytoskeleton.",

Central to this is the kinetochore scaffold KNL1 that integrates the functions of various mitotic regulators including BUB1 and BUBR1. We show that KNL1 contains an extensive array of short linear sequence modules that encompass TxxΩ and MELT motifs and that can independently localize BUB1. Engineered KNL1 variants with few modules recruit low levels of BUB1 to kinetochores but support a robust checkpoint. Increasing numbers of modules concomitantly increase kinetochore BUB1 levels and progressively enhance efficiency of chromosome biorientation. Remarkably, normal KNL1 function is maintained by replacing all modules with a short array of naturally occurring or identical, artificially designed ones. A minimal array of generic BUB recruitment modules in KNL1 thus suffices for accurate chromosome segregation. Widespread divergence in the amount and sequence of these modules in KNL1 homologues may represent flexibility in adapting regulation of mitotic processes to altered requirements for chromosome segregation during evolution.",

        "abstract": "Introduction. Prior studies have revealed that the concordance between biopsy and surgical specimens has been improving over time. However, to date, this has not been analyzed in an African American population, for whom data have often shown more aggressive prostate cancer than for other races. Methods. We analyzed 250 patients who were operated on at the NY Harbor Department of Veterans Affairs for localized prostate cancer between 2003 and 2010. The clinical biopsy scores were compared with the pathological biopsy scores. We compared the concordance using the κ coefficient. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify predictors for poor concordance. Results. This population consisted of 59.6% African Americans, 32% Caucasians, and 8.4% Hispanics. Overall, there was a 50% exact concordance between the biopsy and surgical specimens. The κ was 0.33, indicating fair agreement. Patients with a Gleason score of 6 were found to have an exact concordance 66% of the time, and those with a score of Gleason 7 (3 + 4) had an exact concordance 50% of the time. On univariate and multivariate analyses, only an increasing prostate-specific antigen was associated with reduced concordance. Race was not a significant predictor. Conclusions. These data are in line with prior studies of concordance. Despite being a population with more aggressive prostate cancer, there does not appear to be an increase in the risk of discordance in African American men.",

        "abstract": "The tumor suppressor PTEN plays a critical role in the regulation of multiple cellular processes that include survival, cell cycle, proliferation and apoptosis. PTEN is frequently mutated or deleted in various human cancer cells to promote tumorigenesis. PTEN is regulated by SUMOylation, but the SUMO E3 ligase involved in the SUMOylation of PTEN remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that PIASxα is a SUMO E3 ligase for PTEN. PIASxα physically interacted with PTEN both in vitro and in vivo. Their interaction depended on the integrity of Phosphatase and C2 domains of PTEN, and the region of PIASxα comprising residues 134-347. PIASxα enhanced PTEN protein stability by reducing PTEN ubiquitination, while the mutation of PTEN SUMO1 conjugation sites neutralized the effect of PIASxα on PTEN protein half-life. Functionally, PIASxα, as a potential tumor suppressor, negatively regulated the PI3K-Akt pathway through stabilizing PTEN protein. Overexpression of PIASxα led to G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, thus triggered the inhibition of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Together, our studies suggest that PIASxα is a novel SUMO E3 ligase for PTEN and it positively regulates PTEN protein level in tumor suppression.",

        "abstract": "Amplification of chromosome 20q is frequently found in various types of human cancers, including breast cancer. The list of candidate oncogenes in 20q has expanded over the past decade. Here, we investigate whether FAM83D (family with sequence similarity 83, member D) on chromosome 20q plays any role in breast cancer development. The expression level of FAM83D is significantly elevated in breast cancer cell lines and primary human breast cancers. High expression levels of FAM83D are significantly associated with poor clinical outcome and distant metastasis in breast cancer patients. We show that ectopic expression of FAM83D in human mammary epithelial cells promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion along with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Ablation of FAM83D in breast cancer cells induces apoptosis and consequently inhibits cell proliferation and colony formation. Mechanistic studies reveal that overexpression of FAM83D downregulates FBXW7 expression levels through a physical interaction, which results in elevated protein levels of oncogenic substrates downstream to FBXW7, such as mTOR, whose inhibition by rapamycin can suppress FAM83D-induced cell migration and invasion. The results demonstrate that FAM83D has prognostic value for breast cancer patients and is a novel oncogene in breast cancer development that at least in part acts through mTOR hyper-activation by inhibiting FBXW7.",

        "abstract": "NF-кB has been linked to doxorubicin resistance in breast cancer patients. NF-кB nuclear translocation and DNA binding in doxorubicin treated-breast cancer cells have been extensively examined; however its functional relevance at transcriptional level on NF-кB -dependent genes and the biological consequences are unclear. We studied NF-кB -dependent gene expression induced by doxorubicin in breast cancer cells and fresh human cancer specimens with different genetic backgrounds focusing on their p53 status. NF-кB -dependent signature of doxorubicin was identified by gene expression microarrays in breast cancer cells treated with doxorubicin and the IKKβ-inhibitor MLN120B, and confirmed ex vivo in human cancer samples. The association with p53 was functionally validated. Finally, NF-кB activation and p53 status was determined in a cohort of breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy. Doxorubicin treatment in the p53-mutated MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in NF-кB driven-gene transcription signature. Modulation of genes related with invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance (ICAM-1, CXCL1, TNFAIP3, IL8) were confirmed in additional doxorubicin-treated cell lines and fresh primary human breast tumors. In both systems, p53-deficient background correlated with the activation of the NF-кB -dependent signature. Furthermore, restoration of p53WT in the mutant p53 MDA-MB-231 cells impaired NF-кB driven transcription induced by doxorubicin. Moreover, a p53 deficient background and nuclear NF-кB /p65 in breast cancer patients correlated with reduced disease free-survival. This study supports that p53 deficiency is necessary for a doxorubicin driven NF-кB -response that limits doxorubicin cytotoxicity in breast cancer and is linked to an aggressive clinical behavior.",

        "abstract": "K-Ras mutation is detected in over 30% of human malignancies. In particular, 90% of human pancreatic cancers are initiated by K-Ras mutation. Thus, selective elimination of K-Ras mutated cells would be a plausible strategy to prevent or cure the malignancies. In our previous reports, it has been revealed that oncogenic K-Ras promotes the exocytosis of p53 with Snail. In this study, we have followed the final destination of extracellular p53, which is secreted by the Snail complex. Here we provide evidences that p53, exported from K-Ras-mutated cells, is specifically re-endocytosed by oncogenic K-Ras-containing cancer cells. The p53 DNA-binding domain directly associates with caveolin-1 and enters K-Ras mutated cells through early endosome-mediated endocytosis. Using a serial deletion approach, we revealed that a fragment of human p53 extending from 93-143 amino acids (AA) is responsible for binding with caveolin-1 and for endocytosis. In contrast, p53-Snail binding occurs at the 143-193 aa region. Finally, through in vivo study, we confirmed that injected recombinant p53 could be up-taken by tumor tissues, constructed by oncogenic K-Ras transformed MEF cells. In contrast, the tumors formed by H-Ras mutated MEF cells did not accumulate the injected p53 protein. These results indicate that the p53 fragment might be useful as a specific delivery tool into K- Ras mutated cells as well as a diagnostic method.",

        "abstract": "Anti-cancer drugs generally kill cancer cells by apoptosis but fail to do so when they become resistant and escape apoptosis signals. But these resistant cells can still be killed by autophagy. Therefore, drugs having both apoptotic and autophagic abilities are solicited in effective cancer management. In search of such a drug, we examined the efficacy of graveoline, a bioactive compound isolated from Ruta graveolens on skin melanoma A375 cells through the use of specific signaling cascades and their inhibitors. Cytotoxicity of graveoline was tested by conducting MTT assay. Induction of autophagy and apoptosis was checked. Expression of related proteins and their localization were studied by conducting immunoblot assay and through confocal microscopy, respectively. We found graveoline-induced Beclin-1 associated autophagy in A375 cells and 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagy did not affect apoptosis. Conversely, caspase inhibitor that blocked apoptosis did not affect autophagic cell death, suggesting thereby that these two were independent events. Use of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers inhibited cell death, but blocking autophagy did not affect graveoline-induced ROS generation, suggesting that ROS generation ensued autophagy. Thus, graveoline-induced both apoptotic and autophagic cell death in skin melanoma cells, a desirable quality in effective anti-cancer drug design. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Metastatic disease to bone is commonly seen in the advanced stages of many cancers. The cardinal symptom, pain, is often the cause of significant morbidity and reduced quality of life. Treatment of bone pain includes nonsteroidal analgesics and opiates; however, long-term use of these drugs is commonly associated with significant side effects, and tolerance is common. External-beam radiation therapy is effective mainly in localized disease sites. Bone-targeting radiopharmaceuticals are beneficial in the management of patients with multiple metastatic lesions. This article focuses on the 3 most commonly used agents: the Food and Drug Administration-approved (89)Sr-chloride, (153)Sm-ethylenediaminetetramethylene phosphonic acid (EDTMP), and (223)Ra-dichloride. We will discuss the physical characteristics, clinical data, dosage, and administration of these agents, including optimal patient selection and toxicity associated with their use. These radioactive agents have proven efficacy in the treatment of painful osseous metastases from prostate cancer and breast cancer. Significant recent advances include use of these agents in combination with chemotherapy and the use of the α emitter (223)Ra-dichloride in prostate cancer, primarily to improve survival and skeletal related events. The review is presented in 2 parts. The first will discuss the characteristics and clinical use of (223)Ra-dichloride, and the second will discuss the β emitters (89)Sr and (153)Sm-EDTMP.",

Seven electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of FOLFOX4 combined with HMs compared to FOLFOX4 alone. Outcome data for 13 randomized controlled trials were analysed using Review Manager 5.1. Risk of bias for objective outcomes including tumor response and survival was judged as low. Publication bias was not evident. Meta-analyses found the addition of HMs improved tRR (RR 1.25, 95%CI 1.06-1.47, I(2)  = 0%), one year survival (RR 1.51, 95%CI 1.19-1.90, I(2)  = 0%) and quality of life in terms of Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) gained (RR 1.84, 95%CI 1.54-2.19, I(2)  = 0%); alleviated grade 3 and 4 chemotherapy-related AEs for neutropenia (RR 0.33, 95%CI 0.18-0.60, I(2)  = 0%), nausea and vomiting (RR 0.34, 95%CI 0.17-0.67, I(2)  = 0%) and neurotoxicity (RR 0.39, 95%CI 0.15-1.00, I(2)  = 0%), compared to FOLFOX4 alone. The most frequently used herbs were Astragalus membranaceus, Panax ginseng, Atractylodes macrocephala, Poria cocos, Coix lachryma-jobi and Sophora flavescens. In experimental studies, each of these herbs has shown actions that could have contributed to improved tumor response. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Mice with an intestine-specific disruption of VDR (VdrΔIEpC) have abnormal body size, colon structure and imbalance of bile acid metabolism. Lithocholic acid (LCA), a secondary bile acid that activates VDR, is among the most toxic of the bile acids that when overaccumulated in liver causes hepatotoxicity. Since CYP3A4 is a target gene of VDR involved bile acid metabolism, the role of CYP3A4 in VDR biology and bile acid metabolism was investigated. The CYP3A4 gene was inserted into VdrΔIEpC mice to produce the VdrΔIEpC/3A4 line. LCA was administered to control, transgenic-CYP3A4 (Tg-3A4), VdrΔIEpC and VdrΔIEpC/3A4 mice and hepatic toxicity, bile acid levels in liver, intestine, bile and urine were measured. VDR deficiency in intestine of the VdrΔIEpC mice exacerbates LCA-induced hepatotoxicity manifested by increased necrosis and inflammation, due in part to over-accumulation of hepatic bile acids including taurocholic acid and taurodeoxycholic. Intestinal expression of CYP3A4 in the VdrΔIEpC/3A4 mouse line reduces lithocholic acid-induced hepatotoxicity through elevation of LCA metabolism and detoxification, and suppression of bile acid transporter expression in small intestine. This study revealed that intestinal CYP3A4 protects against LCA hepatotoxicity.",

We observed the specific attachment of the functionalized gold plasmonic nanoparticles (AuNPs) targeting CD44(+) human breast cancer cells by conventional and by proposed hyperspectral darkfield microscopy. This wide-field and low phototoxic hyperspectral imaging system has been successful for performing spectral three-dimensional (3D) localization and spectroscopic identification of CD44-targeted PEGylated AuNPs in fixed cell preparations. Such spatial and spectral information is essential for the improvement of nanoplasmonic-based imaging, disease detection and treatment in complex biological environment. Presented system capability for 3D NP tracking will also enable investigation of specific sub-cellular activity with the use of NPs as spectral sensors. (© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

        "abstract": "Multitasking (MT) constitutes engaging in two or more cognitive activities at the same time. MT-training improves performance on untrained MT tasks and alters the functional activity of the brain during MT. However, the effects of MT-training on neural mechanisms beyond MT-related functions are not known. We investigated the effects of 4 weeks of MT-training on regional gray matter volume (rGMV) and functional connectivity during rest (resting-FC) in young human adults. MT-training was associated with increased rGMV in three prefrontal cortical regions (left lateral rostral prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), and left inferior frontal junction), the left posterior parietal cortex, and the left temporal and lateral occipital areas as well as decreased resting-FC between the right DLPFC and an anatomical cluster around the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Our findings suggest that participation in MT-training is as a whole associated with task-irrelevant plasticity (i.e., neural changes are not limited to certain specific task conditions) in regions and the network that are assumed to play roles in MT as well as diverse higher-order cognitive functions. We could not dissociate the effects of each task component and the diverse cognitive processes involved in MT because of the nature of the study, and these remain to be investigated.

        "abstract": "Cigarette smoking (CS), hormone therapy (HT) and folate intake (FI) are each thought to influence colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely defined. The TP53 (p53) protein, encoded by the TP53 tumor suppressor gene that is commonly mutated in CRC, can be readily assessed to differentiate biologically distinct CRC subtypes. In this prospective cohort study, we examined CS, HT, and FI -associated CRC risks by TP53 protein expression level among Iowa Women's Health Study (IWHS) participants. The IWHS recruited 41,836 randomly selected Iowa women, ages 55-69 years, with a valid driver's license at study entry in 1986. Self-reported exposure variables were assessed at baseline. Incident CRC cases were ascertained by annual linkage with the Iowa Cancer Registry. Archived, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens were collected and evaluated for TP53 protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Multivariate Cox regression models were fit to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between CS, HT, or FI and TP53-defined CRC subtypes. Informative environmental exposure and protein expression data were available for 492 incident CRC cases: 222 (45.1%) TP53 negative, 72 (14.6%) TP53 low, and 198 (40.2%) TP53 high. Longer duration (> 5 years) of HT was inversely associated with TP53 high CRCs (RR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.27-0.94). No other statistically significant associations were observed. These data support possible heterogeneous effects from HT on TP53-related pathways of colorectal carcinogenesis in older women.",

        "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to visualize the surgical anatomical structures in the female pelvis by computed tomography and to investigate the components of the parametrium for anatomical education, radiological diagnosis, and surgical simulation. We surgically dissected fresh female cadavers maintained in precise surgical anatomic positions and examined the anatomical structures using experimental fine cell detector multislice computed tomography (FDCT) with a slice thickness of 0.3125 mm. In addition, we established a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction model for precise observation of the surgical anatomy using Materialise's Interactive Medical Image Control System (Mimics). We evaluated two-dimensional (2D) images of the surgical anatomical structures in combination with the 3D reconstruction model. The 3D model was reconstructed from 430 serial axial pelvic CT images of a cadaver. The cardinal ligament, uterosacral ligament, paravesical space, and pararectal space were visualized on the CT images obtained from the surgically dissected part. The parametrium components were clearly distinguished on the surgically dissected side. Based on the information from the dissected side, these components on the undissected side could be distinguished as well. We recognized the parametrium components in the area extirpated during radical hysterectomy. The approach using cadavers, experimental FDCT, and 3D software provided excellent visualization of pelvic structures. High-quality images of surgical anatomical structures provide new insight regarding precise surgical anatomy in the female pelvis. The radiological information has practical usefulness for radiotherapeutic planning and surgical simulation. Clin. Anat., 2013. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Recent epidemiological studies have incriminated diabetes as a risk factor for the development of OSCC, as well as oral premalignant lesions. As for the last 20 years diabetes and oral squamous cell carcinoma rates have been increasing rapidly, therefore a reliable detection method of major saliva proteins as possible biomarkers for OSCC is of key priority. In this study we collected whole saliva samples from patients with diabetes and from healthy subjects. To reduce the risk of failure and to keep the investigation good reproducible, we proposed an examination and saliva collecting technique. The proteins were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. Our findings show that the expression of Annexin A8, Peroxiredoxin-2 and Tyrosine kinase is elevated by patients having diabetes. All these proteins have been previously described in cancer saliva samples also in OSCC. Our current findings showed that testing saliva may be an effective and reliable method for detecting oral cancer in early stages.",

We analyzed CTCL cell lines and lesional tissues using flow cytometry, immunostaining, immunoblotting, cell death, viability and apoptosis assays, small-molecule inhibitors, and shRNA knockdown. We found strong SIRT1 expression among CTCL lines relative to normal lymphocytes. CTCL cells in lesional tissues also expressed SIRT1 strongly. SIRT1 knockdown resulted in reduced cellular metabolism and proliferation, increased apoptosis, and PARP cleavage products. Tenovin-1, which reversibly inhibits class III HDACs (SIRT1 and SIRT2), reduced SIRT enzymatic activity and SIRT1 expression and led to increased apoptosis. These alterations were accompanied by increased FoxO3 in several cell lines and increased nuclear p53, as well as acetylated p53 in wtp53 MyLa CTCL line. A combination of class I/II and class III HDACIs (vorinostat and tenovin-1) produced significantly greater growth inhibition, cell death and apoptosis, as well as superior p53 promoter upregulation in wtp53 MyLa cells compared with either agent alone. This occurred in a partially p53-dependent manner, as these effects were blunted by p53 knockdown. Our results indicate that SIRT1 is strongly expressed in CTCL. Its inhibition results in reduced growth and increased apoptosis of CTCL cells. Furthermore, our findings suggest that some CTCL patients, such as those with wtp53, might benefit more from treatment with a combination of different classes of HDACIs than with a single agent.",

Models were first clustered so that duplicated or very similar ones were grouped together and represented by one model in the cluster. The representatives were then compared with targets using GDT_TS, QCS, and three additional superposition-independent score functions newly developed for CASP10. For each target, the top 15 representatives by each score were pooled to form the Top15Union set. All models in this set were visually inspected by four of us independently using the new plugin, EvalScore, which we developed with the UCSF Chimera group. The best models were selected for each target after extensive debate among the four examiners. Groups were ranked by the number of targets (hits) for which a group's model was selected as one of the best models. The Keasar group had most hits in both categories, with four of 19 FM and eight of 36 ROLL targets. The most successful prediction servers were QUARK from Zhang's group for FM category with three hits and Zhang-server for the ROLL category with seven hits. As observed in CASP9, many successful groups were not true \"template-free\" modelers but used remote templates and/or server models to obtain their winning models. The results of the first ROLL experiment were broadly similar to those of the CASP10 FM exercise. Proteins 2013. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells represent key innate immune cells that restrain viral infection and malignant transformation and help mount an adaptive immune response. To perform such complicated tasks, NK cells express a wide set of inhibitory and activating receptors that alert them against cellular stress without damaging healthy cells. A new family of receptors that recognize nectin and nectin-like molecules has recently emerged as a critical regulator of NK cell functions. The most famous member of this family, DNAX accessory molecule (DNAM-1, CD226), is an adhesion molecule that control NK cell cytotoxicity and interferon-γ production against a wide range of cancer and infected cells. Its ligands CD112 and CD155 have been described in different pathological conditions, and recent evidence indicates that their expression is regulated by cellular stress. Additional receptors have been shown to bind DNAM-1 ligands and modulate NK cell functions bringing another level of complexity. These include CD96 (TACTILE) and TIGIT (WUCAM, VSTM3). Here, we review the role of DNAM-1, TIGIT and CD96 in NK cell biology summarizing the recent advances made on the role of these receptors in various pathologies, such as cancer, viral infections and autoimmunity.Immunology and Cell Biology advance online publication, 17 December 2013; doi:10.1038/icb.2013.95.",

        "abstract": "Autophagy delivers many proteins and cellular components to the lysosome for degradation via selective or nonselective mechanisms. By controlling the stability of defined protein factors, autophagy might regulate cellular processes in a precise and finely-tuned manner. In this study, we demonstrated that autophagy positively regulates the biogenesis of the primary cilium, an antenna-like organelle that senses the environment and transduces signals. Defects in the function or structure of cilia cause a number of human diseases called \"ciliopathies.\" We found that the autophagosome membrane anchored protein LC3 interacts with OFD1 (oral-facial-digital syndrome 1) and removes it from the centriolar satellite upon serum starvation to initiate primary cilium biogenesis. OFD1 regulation and primary cilium formation are defective in autophagy-deficient cells, and reducing OFD1 protein levels through RNA interference rescues primary cilium formation. More strikingly, knockdown of OFD1 induces primary cilium formation in unstressed cells as well as in a human breast cancer cell that was previously reported to have lost the ability to form primary cilia. These findings therefore suggest an unexpected link among autophagy, ciliogenesis, ciliopathy, and cancers.",

        "abstract": "Neisseria gonorrhoeae (the gonococcus, Gc) triggers a potent inflammatory response and recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection. Gc survives exposure to neutrophils despite these cells' antimicrobial products, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS production in neutrophils is initiated by NADPH oxidase, which converts oxygen into superoxide. The subunits of NADPH oxidase are spatially separated between granules (gp91(phox)/p22(phox)) and the cytoplasm (p47(phox), p67(phox) and p40(phox)). Activation of neutrophils promotes the coassembly of NADPH oxidase subunits at phagosome and/or plasma membranes. While Gc expressing opacity-associated (Opa) proteins can induce neutrophils to produce ROS, Opa-negative Gc does not stimulate neutrophil ROS production. Using constitutively Opa- and OpaD+ Gc in strain FA1090, we now show that the difference in ROS production in primary human neutrophils between these backgrounds can be attributed to differential assembly of NADPH oxidase. Neutrophils infected with Opa- Gc showed limited translocation of NADPH oxidase cytoplasmic subunits to cellular membranes, including the bacterial phagosome. In contrast, these subunits rapidly translocated to neutrophil membranes following infection with OpaD+ Gc. gp91(phox) and p22(phox) were recruited to Gc phagosomes regardless of bacterial Opa expression. These results suggest that Opa- Gc interferes with the recruitment of neutrophil NADPH oxidase cytoplasmic subunits to membranes - in particular the p47(phox) \"organizing\" subunit - to prevent assembly of the holoenzyme, resulting in an absence of the oxidative burst.",

        "abstract": "The ability of cells to respond to changes in nutrient availability is essential for the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis and viability. One of the key cellular responses to nutrient withdrawal is the upregulation of autophagy. Recently, there has been a rapid expansion in our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of mammalian autophagy induction in response to depletion of key nutrients. Intracellular amino acids, ATP, and oxygen levels are intimately tied to the cellular balance of anabolic and catabolic processes. Signaling from key nutrient-sensitive kinases mTORC1 and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is essential for the nutrient sensing of the autophagy pathway. Recent advances have shown that the nutrient status of the cell is largely passed on to the autophagic machinery through the coordinated regulation of the ULK and VPS34 kinase complexes. Identification of extensive crosstalk and feedback loops converging on the regulation of ULK and VPS34 can be attributed to the importance of these kinases in autophagy induction and maintaining cellular homeostasis.Cell Research advance online publication 17 December 2013; doi:10.1038/cr.2013.166.",

The basal electrical surface properties of cells are known. Changes in cell function may affect these surface properties, and those changes can be detected by electrokinetic measurements. The surface charge density of the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were measured as a function of pH. A four-component equilibrium model was used to describe the interaction between the solution ions and the breast cancer cell surface. The experimental and the theoretical charge variation curves of the breast cancer cells at pH 2.5-9 were in agreement. Measurements of the cellular malondialdehyde levels with high performance liquid chromatography were used to determine the extent of lipid peroxidation. The acid and base functional group concentrations and average association constants with hydroxyl ions were smaller in breast cancer cell membranes treated with cisplatin or novel dinuclear platinum(II) complexes compared with untreated cancer cells, and the average association constants with hydrogen ions were higher. The levels of lipid peroxidation products in breast cancer cells treated with cisplatin or novel dinuclear platinum(II) complexes were also higher than in untreated cancer cells.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES:Randomized trials have shown that annual or biannual screening by guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (gFOBTs) reduces colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality. Few clinical studies have evaluated diagnostic performance of gFOBT through validation by colonoscopy in all participants. We aimed for a comprehensive evaluation of diagnostic performance of gFOBT by age and sex under routine screening conditions.METHODS:Our analysis is based on 20,884 colonoscopies following up a positive gFOBT and 182,956 primary screening colonoscopies documented in a state-wide quality assurance program in Bavaria, Germany, in 2007-2009. Positive likelihood ratios (LR+), which represent an integrative measure of diagnostic performance, were derived, by age groups (55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74 years) and sex, from a joint and comparative analysis of prevalences of colorectal neoplasms in both groups.RESULTS:Overall LR+ (95% confidence intervals) were 1.11 (1.06-1.15), 1.80 (1.72-1.88), and 5.04 (4.64-5.47) for non-advanced adenoma, advanced adenoma, and cancer, respectively. Assuming a specificity of gFOBT of 95.2%, as recently observed in a German study among 2,235 participants of screening colonoscopy, these LR+ would translate to sensitivities of 5.3%, 8.6%, and 24.2% for the three outcomes, respectively. Diagnostic performance was similarly poor among women and men and across age groups.CONCLUSIONS:The performance of gFOBT under routine screening conditions is even worse than previously estimated from clinical studies. In routine screening application, gFOBTs are expected to miss more than 9 out of 10 advanced adenomas and 3 out of 4 cancers. These results underline the need and the potential for better noninvasive CRC screening tests.Am J Gastroenterol advance online publication, 17 December 2013; doi:10.1038/ajg.2013.424.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES:The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in the western world has been rapidly increasing. The trends in obesity and other lifestyle-associated factors have been hypothesized to be important drivers of this increase. We tested this hypothesis by comparing changes in these factors with changes in EAC incidence over time between three western countries.METHODS:Data on EAC incidence trends were abstracted from the SEER-9 registry (1975-2009) for the United States, from multiple cancer registries (1980-2004) in Spain, and from Eindhoven Cancer Registry in the Netherlands (1974-2010). In addition, we collected trend data on obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The trend data were analyzed using log-linear regression.RESULTS:In 1980, the EAC incidence was similar among the three countries ((0.46-0.63) per 100,000). EAC incidence increased in all, with the largest increase observed in the Netherlands, followed by the United States and Spain (estimated annual percentage of change=9.7%, 7.4%, 4.3%, respectively). However, this pattern was not observed in lifestyle factors associated with EAC. With regards to obesity, the United States clearly has had the highest prevalence rates both in the past and in the present. For alcohol, the highest consumption rates are seen in Spain. Smoking showed a reverse trend compared with EAC among all three countries in the last 20 years.CONCLUSIONS:International trends in EAC incidence do not match corresponding trends in lifestyle-associated factors including obesity. Our findings suggest that factors other than obesity must be the important drivers for the increase in EAC incidence.Am J Gastroenterol advance online publication, 17 December 2013; doi:10.1038/ajg.2013.420.",

We conducted this study to examine whether H. pylori eradication would affect the occurrence of metachronous gastric cancer after endoscopic resection in patients with early gastric cancer.METHODS:We retrospectively analyzed 2,089 adults who underwent endoscopic resection of gastric low-grade neoplasia, high-grade neoplasia, or differentiated invasive neoplasia from 2004 to 2008 at Asan Medical Center. Of these, a total of 1,007 patients with early gastric cancer were enrolled in this study. We evaluated the demographic data, the pathology, and the incidence of metachronous recurrence by dividing them into three groups: those without active H. pylori infection (Hp negative group, n=340), those who successfully underwent H. pylori eradication (eradicated group, n=485), and those who failed or did not undergo H. pylori eradication (noneradicated group, n=182).RESULTS:Metachronous recurrence was diagnosed in 75 patients, including 17 in the Hp, 34 in the eradicated, and 24 in the noneradicated groups. Median time to metachronous recurrence was 18 months (range, 7-75 months). The incidence of metachronous gastric cancer was 10.9 cases per 1,000 person-years in the Hp negative group, 14.7 cases per 1,000 person-years in the eradicated group, and 29.7 cases per 1,000 person-years in the noneradicated group. The hazard ratios in the noneradicated group compared with the Hp negative and eradicated groups were 2.5 (P<0.01) and 1.9 (P=0.02), respectively. H. pylori eradication reduced metachronous recurrence of gastric neoplasm, which was also shown in the secondary analysis of 1,487 patients with low-grade neoplasia and early gastric cancer.CONCLUSIONS:Successful H. pylori eradication may reduce the occurrence of metachronous gastric cancer after endoscopic resection in patients with early gastric cancer.Am J Gastroenterol advance online publication, 17 December 2013; doi:10.1038/ajg.2013.404.",
